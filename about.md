My name is Jeff and I'm a nerd. I like all of the classic nerdy things including

* Computers/Programming
* Roleplaying Games (I'm playing [Dungeon World](www.dungeon-world.com) and [D&D 3.5](https://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/archives)
* [Photography)(https://www.flickr.com/photos/allthingsdork/), although it's been awhile
* Comic Books

I'm sure I'm leaving something out, but you get the idea. You can find me on

* [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/DarkAndNerdy)
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/jeffery.smith.52438)
* [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/1/110230710699411860801/posts/p/pub) although I don't really post there
* [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jeffery-smith/2/16/37a/)
* [Github](https://github.com/bobbidigital)

....pretty sure that's everything. I'm also the president and co-founder of the [Chicago Nerd Social Club](http://www.chicagonerds.com), an organizaiton I'm really proud to be a part of.

I love meeting new peeps so feel free to drop me a line.
