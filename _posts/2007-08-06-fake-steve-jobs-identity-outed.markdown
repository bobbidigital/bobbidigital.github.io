<p>Well, it's a bit of a sad day for some of us. The Fake Steve Jobs who has entertained a lot of us for quite some time has been outed. For some of us a sort of sick curiosity has been filled, but at the same time you feel a bit of sadness.</p>
<p>For those who haven't had the joy of reading the Fake Steve Jobs, he's been writing for almost a year at <a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/">http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/</a> under the voice of CEO Steve Jobs, posing the site as his "Secret Diary". Some of the posts have been downright hilarious, especially if your into the culture of Apple and know a bit about Steve's way of doing things.</p>
<p>Anyway, turns out the guy works for Forbes and soon will begin making his posts as Fake Steve Jobs under the Forbes.com website address. Read the official story <a href="http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article2207645.ece">here</a></p>
