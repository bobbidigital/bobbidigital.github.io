<p>Well my search for a GTD implementation that I'm in love with has ended. I'll be writing my own I guess =) I'm looking to do a web based implementation with a mobile version. Lets see how long it actually takes since I've NEVER developed in PHP and I'm not much of a web designer. Gives me something to do at least.</p>
