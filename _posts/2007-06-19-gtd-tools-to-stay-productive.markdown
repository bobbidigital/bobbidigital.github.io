  content: "Jeff, that's a long list, but I know it must still be missing some. I
    wonder if there's a list like that on Wikipedia. Folks are so nuts about their
    particular productivity tools that you'd think there'd be a bunch listed there.\r\n\r\nI
    keep reading about Kinkless; can you tell me what's so great about it?  And likewise
    Thinking Rock, though I never heard of it?"

  content: "My bad Gordon, missed this post. The things i like about Kinkless are\r\n\r\n1.
    Quicksilver integration. Although recently iGTD's Quicksilver integration has
    become VERY awesome.\r\n\r\n2. Kinkless allows me to get rid of a lot of the thinking
    that I normally do with tasks. It color codes which tasks are next action items
    amongst the see if items that just need to get done. MAJOR feature for me.\r\n\r\n3.
    iCal integration, which leads to Palm Treo Integration. iGTD will be taking that
    step soon...i can feel it. (They have iPod sync at the moment)\r\n\r\n4. I LOVE
    LOVE LOVE OmniOutliner, so the idea of something built off of it makes me feel
    warm and fuzzy.\r\n\r\n5. More of an extension on 4. It's OmniOutliner, which
    has great apple script capabilities. (That's all kinkless really is) so it makes
    customization much simpler.  \r\n\r\nI must admit though, I've been having a secret
    love affair with iGTD lately. I might bail ship soon, but who knows with OmniFocus
    coming out. *Le Sigh*  decisions decisions. I waste more time on choosing a solution
    than actually getting things done. =)"

<p>You know me, I love GTD tools. Lifehacker has a pretty comprehensive list of GTD tools for use. I've used a few of them, most notably KGTD (kinkless is my current GTD implementation on my Mac for personal stuff) and Thinking Rock for my work implementation. Thinking Rock is a solid implementation of GTD but kind of sucks in the performance department. (I mean it IS Java) Check out the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/getting-things-done/-270170.php"> here at Lifehacker</a></p>
