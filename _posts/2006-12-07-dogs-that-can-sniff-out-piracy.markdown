<p>Serio<img width="111" height="168" align="left" title="dogs" id="image61" alt="dogs" src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/airporta160806.thumbnail.jpg" />usly, this isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t a joke. How the hell do you fight piracy by having optical disk sniffing dogs? So does that mean anyone who has burned media is subject to a search? Do I have to prove that I own have a legal cause to use materials on burned optical media? I mean this just sounds so insane that you would imagine it would be shut down immediately in even the most circus acts of courts or governments.  I guess you can never tell the full potential of idiots.</p>
