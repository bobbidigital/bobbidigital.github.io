  content: I would assume that YouTube was the largest competition for Google Video.  They're
    the two biggest video sites I know of, at least.  Not entirely sure why this is
    a bad move in that case.

  content: I guess my main feeling is would you buy a car that doesn't go? It may
    not be a bad move, but what's the plan for it? It's kinda like the War in Iraq.
    Too many companies buy shit and then piss it away. Look at Microsoft and or Yahoo...

  content: Your boys at Google are off their rocker's anyway. The are blanketing the
    bayarea with free wifi as we speak. I am sure tha's not cheap. Did you hear me
    free. They are doing the area I work in in like a week. How the hell am I supposed
    to sell DSL service with that going on.

<p><img align="right" src="http://www.gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/10/gootube.jpg" />Some ignorant bastard is patting himself on the back with the whole "GooTube" monicker. To me it sounds like an extension of the Naughty America network. GooTube? I'd expect nothing but porn on a site with a name like that. But even worse it's not porn, it's Google and You Tube combined into one happy package.</p>
<p>Now I've got to admit, I'm not 100% sure wtf Googlel is thinking on this one. I don't claim to have the forward thinking abilities of everyone at Google, but I mean come on? YouTube? If I recall YouTube is NOT a profitable company, NEVER has been a profitable company and NEVER had any intentions on becoming profitable? So did Google just make this purchase so they can say "We're now bigger the MySpace". Because we all know the goal of the Internet these days is to out-do MySpace.</p>
<p>I'm extremely curious to see what the plans are with this aquisition. I know YouTube had signed a deal with CBS to delver specific types of content, but again I'm still not seeing this thing paying for itself. I would imagine that the costs rise exponentially with the number of content providers. More people uploading typically means more people downloading which means more bandwith. Is my math wrong? Am I missing something here? Or should we just be expecting a pay per upload business model coming soon? I'm pretty sure that's killed a few other companies. Anyone ever hear of that Napster thing?</p>
