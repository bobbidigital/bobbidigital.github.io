<p><a href="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/android-versus-iphone.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-651" title="android-versus-iphone" src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/android-versus-iphone.png" alt="" width="191" height="202" /></a>I had a small love affair with an Android phone. It was a quick fling that lasted about 2 weeks. As much as I should be, I'm not ashamed of what I've done and have learned quite a bit from the experience.&Acirc;&nbsp; The first thing I learned is that the iPhone has some SERIOUS competition on its hands. The next thing I learned is that the iPhone is still a better phone, especially for laymen.</p>
<p>I switched to the Samsung Galaxy S as part of my scheme to upgrade to an iPhone 4 practically for free. (I borrowed the Galaxy S, which allowed me to sell my 3GS for $200 dollars and use the proceeds to buy the iPhone 4) The first thing that impressed me about the phone was its beautiful screen. It's bright, crisp and large. The phone was light in my hand and had all the little things the iPhone doesn't. (Expandable storage larger screen e,and a removable battery)</p>
<p>I quickly fell in love with the Android notifications panel.<a href="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Notification2-281x5001.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-650" title="Notification2-281x500" src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Notification2-281x5001.png" alt="" width="159" height="282" /></a> It was so nice to have one place where applications can update me as to their status. I can see Twitter replies, new e-mails, new voicemails, text messages all in one neat little place. Plus the notification bar prevented me from being interrupted if I happened to be working on something. At the top of the phone, there was just a nice, gentle message letting me know there was new activity. It was like <a href="http://growl.info/" target="_blank">Growl</a> for a phone. Awesome.</p>
<p>The phone's call quality was good. My core set of applications happened to have Android versions as well, so I didn't feel completely crippled by the switch. The contact syncing feature with Facebook and Google is absolutely amazing. Life was great....on the surface.</p>
<p>After day 3 however, I noticed the phone was really dragging. Everything seemed to take 3x as long on the Android phone. I timed some web surfing on the phone and was appalled at the response times I was getting. (Both over 3G and Wifi) Looking at the task manager, I noticed that there were a metric shit-ton of applications running, half of which I had never launched. After killing them, life returned to normal, for a bit.&Acirc;&nbsp; Before long, applications would continuously spring back to life and consume more precious resources. What gives? After doing some research I discovered that the Android phone was actually a portable time machine, which would force its user back to 1997. Confused?&Acirc;&nbsp; I'll explain.</p>
<p>The Android platform is SO open, that it allows carriers to load up the phone image with tons of crap software, which was lovingly referred to as "crapware" in the past. Sound familiar? Well it should, because it's exactly what PC manufacturers did back in the day. You could never just open up your brand new Gateway PC and start gaming without first re-formatting the hard drive to get rid of all the crapware. It was annoying on the PC and it is even more annoying on my cell phone. But I set out to give Android a test drive, not AT&amp;Ts polluted version of it. So I did some research and figured out how to get a vanilla copy of Android that was&Acirc;&nbsp; compatible with my phone, wipe the operating system and install a clean version of Android. Boy did it make a WORLD of difference.&Acirc;&nbsp; Once I had a clean install of&Acirc;&nbsp; Android, the phone was snappy and responsive. I was happy again, but then day 6 came.</p>
<p>When day 6 arrived I was doing all of my social media stuff on the phone. The CTA applications weren't that good, but they were usable. I was ready for the next step, putting music on the phone. I had heard about <a href="http://www.doubletwist.com/dt/Home/Index.dt" target="_blank">Double Twist</a>, an application that would provide an interface to my iTunes library that would work with Android. (Of course it only works with non-DRM music, but that's not DT's fault) The interface was nice, clearly inspired by iTunes, and user <a href="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DoubleTwist2_610x400.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-652" style="margin: 8px;" title="DoubleTwist2_610x400" src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DoubleTwist2_610x400.jpg" alt="" width="289" height="189" /></a>friendly. I plugged in my Galaxy S just to have nothing happen. I followed the instructions that DoubleTwist provided to the letter, but still no luck. I quickly guessed that this was a problem with the phone and not the Double Twist software. I phoned my friend who actually owned the phone and he said he had experienced the same problems. Through some research and tinkering I discovered that the phone needed to be in Development Mode in order for the disk to mount. (This is most likely a bug) Not only that, but when the phone is plugged into the computer in USB storage mode, you can't access your music frmo the phone. This adds about 4 extra steps anytime I want to listen to music on my phone AND charge it via USB on my computer.</p>
<p>After all of that, I've finally got music on my phone. Playing it turned out to be the painful part. You take for granted what a great music player the iPhone actually is, until you have to go find a player. The android players are functional for the most part, but none of them have the polish that the iPhone has. The problems with these players could be an entire post by itself, but suffice it to say, all of the players were just "functional".&Acirc;&nbsp; While we're on the subject of audio, the other problem with Android is its openness and therefore lack of a clear device controller in certain instances. What do I mean? Well, lets say for instance you accidentally launch two audio based applications. One doesn't cancel the other out, you get both of them playing at the same time. Hearing Jay-Z drop hot rhymes over the Wrath of Khan soundtrack sounds like a good idea, but it really isn't.</p>
<p>My last issue with the Android won't be a problem for 95% of you according to market share figures. I'm a Mac user. When I'm on my iPhone, it feels like an extension of my desktop. I have a number of iPhone apps that are mobile versions of apps I use on my Macbook Pro. (Omnifocus, MindNode and Papers to name a few) The Mac/iPhone combination is powerful and unified. The Android device, while nice and pretty, didn't fit neatly into my ecosystem. I had my Macbook/iPad and then my phone was off on an island. For many people this won't be a problem, especially those of you who leverage a lot of cloud services. But I haven't made completely bought into the cloud computing thing and I'm still a fan of my fat apps.</p>
<p>I ultimately have ended back on the iPhone, but that's not to say that the Samsung Galaxy S (and Android in general) wasn't a great device. It would probably do well by a great many people. Apple could learn a few things from Android. But the reality is, Android just doesn't seem to have the polish that the iPhone has.&Acirc;&nbsp; Every action I do seems to take two or three clicks too many. For example, in order for a text message to be marked as "READ", I can't just go into the conversation's thread. I have to go into the thread and then click on the specific message I want marked as read. Annoying, but not a total deal breaker. It also requires too much "maintenance" in my opinion to keep the phone running in a decent manor.</p>
<p>My fear for Android is that less technically savvy consumers may have a bad experience with Android that is actually the fault of the carrier, who bloats the operating system beyond comprehension, or the fault of the handset manufacturer, who either implements poor design choices or ships an underpowered device. Android is a great platform, but my true love is for my iPhone. Call me a hater, call me a fanboy, but it just feels like home.</p>
