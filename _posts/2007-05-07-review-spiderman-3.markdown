  content: "You know I'm an old comics fan from waaay back. So you know that I automatically
    have some problems with this film because they're switching some major Spidey
    historical facts around. I didn't see the film yet, but all I can say is that
    I hope Gwen Stacy dies, because if she doesn't, that is some bullshit. \r\n\r\nI'm
    still going to see it though..because it's Spiderman. I just fear that it'll turn
    out like that last X-Men movie. They did my man Xavier wrong."

<p><img src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/images/spiderman3.jpg" class="left" border="2" height="154" width="100">If Spiderman 3 has taught us anything about movies, its that opening weekend box office numbers have no bearing on how could the film actually is. Now before everyone starts throwing egg at my face, I did think the movie was entertaining. But I believe director Sam Raimi has become a victim of his own success, as has the franchise itself.</p>
<p>Because Spiderman 3 is such a blockbuster event, I won't go into too many details here right now. Because its a blockbuster it doesn't matter what combination of words or letters I string together on this page, you're going to go see it. And I can't blame you for that because I'd be the same way. The truth of the matter is however, Mr. Raimi and his boys tried to squeeze WAAAY to much story into a single film. This piece could of easily been two separate films, which would have given the plot points the proper exposure they needed instead of the fledgling bits of info we received in this version. Oh well, I think all the fan boys knew that was going to be an issue. Not only were they not properly handled, but sometimes they just downright sucked. Sandman's origin story sucks, period. I hate it when an ongoing series tries to inject characters into an already established past. (Think Palo and Nikki from Lost. <b>**VOMIT**</b>) Same time of BS happens in this flick.</p>
<p>Like I said, I know you have to go see it, because it is Spiderman 3. But remember this post as you sit in that crammed theatre between two big sweaty dorks. You'll be spending the next 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes in anticipation for something that probably ain't gonna show. Namely the quality that you would expect from a record setting blockbuster. </p>
<p>Oh well, see you in 2 years for Spiderman 4. (Cause you know I'm still going to see that shit)</p>
