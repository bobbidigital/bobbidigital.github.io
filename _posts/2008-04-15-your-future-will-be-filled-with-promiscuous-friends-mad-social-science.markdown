  content: Yes this is unfortunate especially with teenagers.  TV and social networks
    have made people even more obsessed with fame.  Sexiness or willing to sleep around
    on MySpace is way to increase the fame.  With just finding out I will be having
    a daughter this worries me but it's all about parenting though.  Good parents
    have good kids.  At least you hope and pray that it works out that way.

<p>This is an interesting article I found that talks a bit about the effects of all the social networking going on combined with a steady bombardment of reality television.  While it doesn't state a ton of actual verifiable fact, it does attempt to make some interesting points. Give it a read if you're interested.</p>
