That was pretty much a given as we navigated through the text books in an attempt to piece together our old world with the new. Flipping through pages looking for that one bit of information takes up a lot more time than we could have imagined. Part of this is our fault for not just having read the core rules cover to cover.</p>
<p>The game plays a lot like an MMORPG. Sorry, I know some people love the game, but that's just how I feel. Everything combat related is centered around powers and abilities that give the game an almost arcade like feel. The good news is this gives an incredible amount of options during game play for characters to do cool things. Even better, they can start doing these cool things right at first level.</p>
<p>Combat seems to flow quicker, even though we played with a couple of first time gamers. The action breakdown is simple and fairly concrete with a standard and a move action for each player. I know it seems like this is pretty much what 3rd edition did, but the language used to describe these actions in the Players Handbook is a lot more clear and straight forward, allowing new gamers to quickly grasp one of the fundamental aspects of the combat system.</p>
<p>The use of minis is no longer suggested, but now is damn near required. Everything regarding movement and range is now listed in squares as opposed to feet. Each square equals 5 feet so it's easy to do the math, but every rule, stat block or guideline is written with the understanding that you'll be playing with minis on a grid map. Most serious gamers are doing this already so it's not a big deal, just a bit more of an initial investment if you don't have the appropriate gear already.</p>
<p>Magic users have probably undergone the most tweaking as a result of the new at-will, encounter and daily spell/ability categories. So no longer are you the caster that's rapidly preparing spells for the day. Nor are you the punk ass who is nothing more than dead weight once your spells are exhausted. With at-will spell categories you always have SOMETHING to do on your turn. This ability is metered slightly by the implement feature, requiring certain powers and abilities to be bound to a particular item or weapon. (Think Gandaulf and his staff) Lose the weapon, lose the at will ability until you get it replaced. Not a bad trade off though. Encounter spells/abilities are like they suggest, once per encounter. And the daily spells are...you guessed it, daily.</p>
<p>So far so good. We're through one section of the pre-made module "Keep on the Shadowfell". It's written almost like an old NES Roleplaying game where you get into a fight, make it to town and talk to random villagers. Rinse repeat. So far it's fun however and the players seem to be enjoying it.</p>
<p>I'll keep you posted on new mechanics as we encounter them, but so far 4th edition gets the thumbs up.</p>
