<p>The acting is bad, the dialogue is bad, the accents are bad and it's one of the most entertaining films I've seen lately.</p>
<p>For fans of the comic book, a lot of you were disappointed when ole blondy Thomas Jane was chosen for the role of The Punisher. Frank Castle is this kind of sick, twisted, relentless character that is tough as nails. Thomas Jane just couldn't pull this off to the full extent of the character. His tough face was laughable. Then you sit him across from John Travolta and you've got a full on comedy on your hands.</p>
<p>That said, I wasn't sure how to fix the film other than recasting a few parts. So over the weekend I decided to go see the reboot "The Punisher: Warzone".&Acirc;&nbsp; This reboot is definitely not an origin story. It drops you right into the action with badass Ray Stevenson plotting a hit on a local mob family. (During their traditional dinner no less)</p>
<p>The beauty of this film is it doesn't take itself seriously at all. It was designed for nothing more than to shock and entertain you. No deep character moments, no exploration of the villains psyche and no hammy voice over explaining the emotions of the character. This movie is closer to Final Destination in its attempt to excite you and gross you out with their over-the-top kills. It's all about finding new ways to bring about someones demise. From grenade launchers to punching people's faces in, you'll find yourself laughing at some of the methods employed by our boy Frank. And it works for me because it fits the type of man I envision&Acirc;&nbsp;Castle to be. No mercy, no middle ground. You're a good guy or a bad guy and your fate can turn that quickly depending on how he perceives you. Even grandmothers aren't safe.</p>
<p>Dominic West plays the villain JigSaw. His character is vain&Acirc;&nbsp;and&Acirc;&nbsp;becomes mortified during his "stunning" transformation to JigSaw. Trust me, they don't dwell on it long. For those of you who watched The Wire, don't expect a Jimmy McNulty performance.&Acirc;&nbsp; His accent is comical as is his body language. Imagine someone doing a Saturday Night Live skit of a mob boss. That's pretty much what you'll get from West. But the script supports this outrageous behavior with everything else around him being equally out of whack.</p>
<p>You'll laugh out loud, you'll gasp for air and you'll wonder just how the little girl in this film is going to pay for all those mental health bills she's going to be racking up. But I'm telling you this movie is FUN. Just don't go in expecting Spiderman. If you go in more along the lines of Snakes On a Plane, you'll be sure to have a great time.</p>
