    <strong>Sacramento Computer Repair...</strong>

    That was a creative and most exellent article. I really enjoyed the read and can't wait to check out some of your previous and upcomming posts! I plan on linking your blog to my site....

<div class="msg 1st">Wow...Microsoft is involved in a class action lawsuit over their "Vista Capable"  logo. Machines labeled "Vista Capable" are not Vista Compatible...it means that  you can run the BASIC version of Vista (there's like 7 versions) but the Basic  version doesn't include many of the highly touted features of the Vista OS, the biggest one being the new shiny Aero Glass interface. </p>
<p></div>Talk about fucked up. Days like these, I'm glad I'm a Mac user.&nbsp; My G5 is capable of running ALL the versions of Leopard including the "Ultimate Super Bundle Pack" version, which is also only $129.</p>
<p>But you gotta admit..Aero Glass is kinda cool looking :)</p>
