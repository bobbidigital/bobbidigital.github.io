<p>As technology advances, new rules have to be put into place to manage the social rules surrounding the new devices born. We had to do it with telephones, cell phones, e-mail and now we need to do it with self-checkout stations at your local grocery store.</p>
<p>I often use the self-checkout line at my supermarket for quick and easy checkouts. I like the idea of self-checkout but not it's implications. (That's a whole different post) But I sit there and watch as we struggle with adapting to this new method of order processing. So instead of just griping about it, I figured I'd come up with the Five Commandments of Self-Checkout.</p>
<h2>I. Thou shalt form 1 line.</h2><br />
Everyone has been in a self-checkout line where there are 4 machines clustered together. For some reason people think it's a brilliant idea that we have a different line for each station. No. Form a single line and the next person in line goes to the newly open machine.</p>
<h2>II. Thou shalt not grocery shop for the month and use self-checkout</h2><br />
Self-checkout is designed for speed. Don't do your thanksgiving day shopping and use self-checkout. It's slow and it's annoying.</p>
<h2><strong>III. Thou shalt learn self-checkout on thine own time.</strong></h2><br />
If you're not familiar with how self-checkout works, don't let your first time with it be when there are 10 people in line behind you and you have 15 items.</p>
<h2>IV. Thou shalt not by produce if thine sight is horribly flawed</h2><br />
Sometimes when you purchase items from self-checkout you need to enter codes from produce and things like that. If you can barely read the screen, you probably shouldn't be using self-checkout.</p>
<h2>V. Thou shalt use bills or credit cards for purchases</h2><br />
I once spent 10 minutes waiting for a guy to pay $17 dollars in nickels via self-checkout. That act alone is worthy of death.</p>
<p>As we start to use it more, more rules will evolve but this is an excellent starting list. Abide by these rules and there will be joy. If not people will talk about you. A lot.</p>
