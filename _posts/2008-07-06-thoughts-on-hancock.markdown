excerpt: |
  Well after some planning Shawn and I went to see Hancock yesterday. Due to poor timing and a lot of mixups we were the only people in the group that actually showed up. So with a grin and a smile we went in the theatre, together, sharing a large popcorn and 2 sodas. Shawn wanted one soda and two straws but I've got to draw the limit somewhere.

  I'm going to keep this as spoiler free as possible so I might be a little soft on the details. Hancock was pretty much exactly what I expected out of a 4th of July movie. Explosions, some good laughs and fair yet believable performances from all those involved. The movie was entertaining and a great popcorn flick, although with rising ticket and gas prices you could probably wait for the DVD.

  content: "Agreed.  I saw this over the weekend in New Jersey and feel pretty much
    the same.  It wasn't incredible, but decent.\r\n\r\nAfter a few other let downs
    (i.e. Zohan, which I walked out of) this summer, I was glad that I didn't waste
    more of my time with a bad movie.\r\n\r\nOne movie I did see, however, and was
    highly impressed with, was In Bruges.  It's a bit more philosophical in nature,
    but the story is great.  I would def recommend it."

<p>Well after some planning Shawn and I went to see Hancock yesterday. Due to poor timing and a lot of mixups we were the only people in the group that actually showed up.

The movie did contain a surprising twist. (Or at least to me) The twist was exciting during its reveal, but then quickly began separating the film into two different movies. The first half of the movie is the one you've been seeing in all the previews. Hancock is an asshole, drunk, degenerate person with super powers. Not exactly someone you would deem a hero. He saves Jason Bateman's character and as a sign of gratitude Bateman decides to help with Hancock's pubic image. This first half of the film is hilarious, full of jokes, laughs and "oh shit" moments.</p>
<p>The second half of the movie though quickly becomes laden with moments of emotion, romance and empty exposition regarding Hancock's background. This may not be be a problem to some, depending on the type of movie you like. This feels like the writer and director used the classic cliche "This movie is going to make you laugh, it's going to make you cry and it's going to make you hope for love." Or some other hippie bullshit to that effect. My point though is that I don't think all of those things (in equal doses) belong in a film. If I go to a comedy, I want to laugh. I want to escape from the reality that life can have some pretty crummy events in it.  Not only that but for me, you have to build up my emotional investment in the characters in order to evoke any form of emotional response to there new found drama. If you spent the first 60 minutes making me laugh my ass off at this guy, chances are your emotions bank with me is empty.</p>
<p>Hancock's origin is a mystery and a lot of talking about his history in the second half of the film doesn't reveal much more. In fact it seemed to just raise a lot more questions. Instead of his past serving as a plot device, it sounded more like an answer to a studio executive's question. They could be setting up for a sequel, however I would imagine that if the sequel follows his origin it will be largely devoid of the humor found in this film.</p>
<p>All in all it's a fun film and worth a watch some time. But if you're one of those people that only sees a movie every once in awhile, I'd save this ticket for <em>Batman The Dark Knight</em>.</p>
