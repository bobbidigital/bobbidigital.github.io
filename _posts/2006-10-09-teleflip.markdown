<p><img align="bottom" src="http://www.teleflip.com/graphics/telefliplogo.gif" />You know me, I'm a sucker for useful tools. So I share with you teleflip. It's a nice little service for those of us who e-mail people on their cell phones. (Instead of typing with yo thumbs) By sending an e-mail to <10digit phone number>@teleflip.com Teleflip will automatically route it to the correct carrier. This way you don't have to play the "Service Name" game. Cingular is "cingularme", Nextel is "page.nextel.com".&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; Now you can just use teleflip and life is golden. You can thank me later.</p>
