<p>You'll need to login to access this, but another sneak peak at some D&amp;D 4e stuff. I've already preordered my books. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786950633">Amazon 3 book set)</a><a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/4e/20080314_drdd_1full.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/4e/20080314_drdd_1th.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="303" width="172" /></a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786950633"> </a></p>
<p>Don't be a punk. Order it.</p>

<h4>Number One: Directing Damage</h4><br />
Don't play the warlord if your only idea of a good time is personally wreaking havoc on your foes. I love the name of the warlord class. I supported using the name instead of the original "marshal" name we'd drafted from 3rd Edition. But some players' first impression on hearing the name "warlord" is that the class must be tougher than all the other characters, the nastiest battlefield hack-and-slasher in the game.</p>
<p>The warlord can hold his own in melee and will frequently save the day thanks to outright combat mojo, but every warlord is more effective as a commander than as a lone hero.</p>
