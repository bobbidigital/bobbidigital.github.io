excerpt: "So, lets say your dumb enough to be out drinking and driving. If you get
  pulled over and blow over the legal limit what's the first defense you think of?
  Source code of course!\r\n\r\nI know this sounds crazy, but it does make a lot of
  sense when you think about it. In reality, the machine you're blowing into is making
  the determination of whether you're intoxicated or not. We've all worked with buggy
  software, so who's to say the software in the breathlizer is any better than Windows
  95? You could be receiving a DUI or DWI based on faulty software!\r\n"

A Minnesota man has done just that. After being pulled over and blowing over the legal limit, his court room defense is demanding to see the source code! If a machine is accusing him of being drunk, he has the right to challenge that machine in court. But of course a machine can't be cross examined so you end up with the defendant pouring over pages of source code. But does the state of Minnesota have the rights to the source code? I'm sure the state isn't developing breahtlizer systems. Oh what a tangled web.</p>
