<p>I often get dumbfounded by my own headlines. This one is no different. Many blog sites are reporting a claim that the Wii is said to attract cockroaches. I guess the Wii is supposed to emit a particular frequency that equates to a cockroach party in your living roome.</p>
<p>I would imagine that this rumor is being started by someone at Sony. Even Microsoft wouldn't stoop that low. But how can you trust a company that puts rootkits on their audio CD's?</p>
