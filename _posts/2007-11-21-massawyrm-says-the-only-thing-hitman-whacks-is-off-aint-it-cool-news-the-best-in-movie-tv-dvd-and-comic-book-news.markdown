<p>I had been considering going to see this film. The first preview left me with a strong desire to sleep, but the second preview looked bad ass. I was a little disappointed with them casting Timothy Olyphant, but whatever. I would give it a chance. Not after this review. I'll wait for the DVD to come out. I'm not doing anything next weekend..</p>
