<p>I've been meaning to post this for awhile. Hal will call me a slacker and probably punch me in the face. (If he flies to Chicago)  It's old, but still a cool way to waste time.</p>
<blockquote><p>While it's not technically an Easter egg, one of the most eye-popping tips in last Sunday's <a href="http://lifehacker.com/371083/top-10-software-easter-eggs">Top 10 Easter eggs post</a> comments was a pointer to a telnet server that broadcasts Star Wars Episode IV to your command line as animated text. You didn't read that wrong. Give it a try: from any command line, type <code>telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl</code> and sit back to watch the show. This is the least productive thing you'll do all day, but you know what they say about all work and no play. After the jump, see a handful of screenshots&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;just 4 of the 13,935 frames that make up the entire movie.</blockquote><br />
