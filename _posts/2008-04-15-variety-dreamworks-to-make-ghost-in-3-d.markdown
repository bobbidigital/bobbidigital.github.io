  content: I always wanted to watch that series because of the cyberpunk aspect to
    it.  If you are reading Neuromancer I am sure you are into everything cyberpunk.  You
    should rent Johnny Mnemonic which is basically Neuromancer in a cheesy 90s way.

I'm going to be labeled as a traitor, but I have yet to stay awake for this film. I own it and intend to give it shot number 23 sometime this week. Maybe I should watch it in chunks on my iPhone. I think it's all the soothing music and chanting.&Acirc;&nbsp; Actually if I remember there are a lot of anime breasts in it, so on the train is probably not the best spot.</p>
