  content: Considering I am a FPS fanatic (ok, Call of Duty 4 is my video crack) and
    delve into RPG/Strategy sparingly, I can say without a doubt you are not being
    a prick. The reason? You choose to enjoy the RPGs as an escape (as it should be)
    where people who play not only immerse themselves into the game but LIVE that
    game (just while playing though. Real world and fantasy merging tends to lead
    to death and jail sentences. Keep it classy!) by speaking the 'language'. There
    are people who are so curious about the WoW and the Everquests and even Black
    and White(!) and pick up the vernacular to offset the fact they were indeed school
    jocks and picked on the same kids who spoke the language said ex-jocks are picking
    up. It's cool to be geeky and nerdy and know how to play WoW and know what a Level
    is besides that thing in a toolbox. You are seeking like minded individuals who
    want to be as deeply immersed as yourself. I call that being passionate about
    what you do, be it games, films, books, or otherwise. Good opinion. Now, I'm back
    to imagining what my KD ratio is going to be tonight.

<p>I should probably preface this by saying "In My Humble Opinion" but the reality is this blog is nothing more than a collection of opinions. But I guess I've already done the preface thing so I'm just going to hop into it.</p>
<p>I remember when I first started in the MMO space with Everquest, I had high hopes for the game to be a computer version of Dungeons &amp; Dragons the table top game. In a lot of ways I was pleasantly pleased, but in the one area that was more important to me than any other I was disappointed. The role playing aspect.</p>
<p>The thing I like about video games, role playing games, films and books is the feeling of total immersion. Out of all of these mediums of entertainment, table top role playing games seem to have the highest potential for immersion. You can literally do anything, say anything. (Provided a decent game master) You are only limited by your imagination. I loved spending hours being the sneaky rogue trying to con the mayor of the town into my nefarious plan. Or being the paladin pleading with the church to evacuate the town before the dragon shows up. Beyond the skill checks and the combat sequences, role playing is where the game truly began to unfold and become memorable.</p>
<p>With Everquest (and even World of Warcraft) I was a bit naive in my thinking that more people would be like minded. I signed up for the role playing server thinking that gamers would remain in character and it would literally be like another world. Instead my hopes were shattered as people approached me and said "Hey dude, let's group. More XP and loot". Now I know there are different levels of role playing, but come on lets give it a chance? And I guess it bothers me even more because these people have CHOSEN the role playing server to play on and then refuse to do it. To me this is the biggest thing holding back MMO's from being the absolute king dog in the entertainment business. (In reality it's probably already close but stick with me for the sake of argument)</p>
<p>There is no realistic way to enforce role playing on servers. I've tried to think and think of different solutions and so far the only thing I can think of is a complaint system. If enough people were role playing on a server and complaints were followed up on then most gamers who are not interested in role playing will simply move to different servers. It would honestly be too cumbersome for them to communicate with players. Let's look at a possible exchange.</p>
<p>"help?"</p>
<p>"Sure lad..Do I know you?"</p>
<p>"need help with Sven quest"</p>
<p>"Ah yes, I know Sven. Good lad but he gets in quite a bit of trouble don't you think?"</p>
<p>"Can u help? too low lvl"</p>
<p>"Aye lad...but I'm waiting for a group of my friends."</p>
<p>"Group"</p>
<p>"I don't know that I understand you."</p>
<p>"invite pls. thx"</p>
<p>This exchange goes on more than most of you care to admit. Now if this type of interaction was common for the person who DOESN'T want to role play then I imagine it won't be long before they move servers just for the sake of brevity.  I should also be more specific. I'm not looking to rate the quality of role players, but I'm looking for people to at least try it and keep the game's "meta" information out of casual pubic chat channels. Don't tell me you're too low level, tell me you've never been there or you don't think you're skills are adequate. For just about every in game situation there are a million and one ways to communicate the information without using the detailed terms of the game itself.</p>
<p>My friend Nic says it's kind of elitist and I can see his point. But I'm not looking for it to be this way on all servers, just on the servers flagged as role playing or even come up with a new classification. All I'm saying is that it isn't unreasonable to allow people who want to experience the game a certain way an easy opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>What do you think? Am I being an elitist prick?</p>
