<p><img class="size-full wp-image-586 alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 2px;" title="300b8nq" src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/300b8nq.jpg" alt="300b8nq" width="204" height="310" />I love Batman. I love Neil Gaiman.&Acirc;&nbsp; So you can imagine my delight when I originally heard about this project, although with the "death" of Batman I wasn't quite sure what to expect. The first issue captivated me and even left me with a huge sense of puzzlement as I looked at Batman's friends and enemies recount their tales of first acquaintances and ultimately the Dark Knight's death. Each tale was told from a different perspective, never holding up to the memories of previous speakers.</p>
<p>What moved me most was the second issue though. Bruce meets his mother in his mind as he straddles the line between life and death. The dialogue between him and his mother, coupled with his resolute stance on what it means to be a hero was a good way to wrap the 2-issue arc. I know a lot of people weren't happy with it and wondered what Gaiman was trying to say, but I think his message was clear. (Save the ambiguous last 3 panels) The message is that the Batman is more than just a man. He can never give up, he can never give in. He'll continue fighting, even from the brink of death. The sense of heroism that it gave me immediately made me think of Supergirl's death in Crisis on Infinite Earths, albeit on a much smaller scale.</p>
<p>I don't know that Batman would want a large funeral, if a funeral at all. He'd probably prefer you set him on fire and push him out into a lake in Gotham. (Viking style) I thought this was a faithful way to temporarily say goodbye to my favorite hero. Despite all this book does, Gaiman isn't really saying anything new. However I do love <strong>how</strong> he's saying it. Go read it.</p>
