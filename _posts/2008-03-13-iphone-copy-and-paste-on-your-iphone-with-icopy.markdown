<p>UPDATE: My bad. Turns out this was just a proof of concept.&Acirc;&nbsp; Not an ACTUAL&Acirc;&nbsp; release or intended to be used.&Acirc;&nbsp; Turns out I need to get laid. He's probably right.</p>
<p>Don't get excited. This sucks.  No matter how computer illiterate this guy may or may not be, you would think at the VERY LEAST he would realize this product sucks when his demo video is 3 minutes long. If it takes you 3 minutes to show me how to use cut-and-paste.  It will only take me 3 seconds to predict it's future. Nobody will use it.</p>
<p>But for those who maybe interested in the technology behind it. Here you go. Apple really needs to get on the ball.</p>
