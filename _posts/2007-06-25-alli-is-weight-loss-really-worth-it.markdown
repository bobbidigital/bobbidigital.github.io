    Great post! I really liked the content and disposition in your topic!...

<p>I know this isn't tech, but there are somethings that just absolutely have to be talked about. <a href="http://www.myalli.com/howdoesitwork/treatmenteffects.aspx">Alli</a> is a new drug out on the market that supposedly is getting a lot of press in medical circuits. I'm not here to debate the trugs merrits, but simply to ask a question. What would you deal with, in order to lose weight?</p>
<p>Alli's side effects, also known as "treatment effects" inlcude the following. Now reembmer, this is STRAIGHT off of their own website.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gas with oily spotting</li>
<li>Loose stools</li>
<li>More frequent stools that maybe hard to control</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Not sure about you, but I've got enough Loose stools to be worried about my weight loss program causing them as well. So considering how unpleasant these treatment effects are, what's Alli's suggestion to help you out?</p>
<ul>
<li>While no one likes experiencing treatment effects, they might help you think twice about eating questionable fat content. If you think of it like that, alli can act like a security guard for your late-night cravings</li>
<li>You may not usually get gassy, but it's a possibility when you take alli. The bathroom is really the best place to go when that happens</li>
<li>You may feel an urgent need to go to the bathroom. Until you have a sense of any treatment effects, it's probably a smart idea to wear dark pants, and bring a change of clothes with you to work</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>This is one of the few times that I'm hoping that I've been totally duped. Please God someone tell me this is a sick joke. Am I really reading this? Please read <a href="http://www.myalli.com/howdoesitwork/treatmenteffects.aspx"> the website</a> and tell me I'm wrong. Please.</p>
<p>More importantly though, why is the drug industry the only industry that can get away with things like this? Could you imagine if you purchased a car that "Could cause discharge of gas through the ventilation system?" Why do we accept these, for lack of a better term, "defects" in our drugs? Do we want to lose weight that bad? Lord knows I don't. I like being able to controlmy stools.</p>
