<p>Now I can feel ok about moving to Amazon's service.  Constantly rooting for the underdog.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Apple confirmed Thursday that the iTunes Store has surpassed Wal-Mart to become the number one music retailer in the US, based on the latest data from the NPD Group. <span class="minor2">[Updated with info from Apple press release.]</span></strong></blockquote><br />

<p>Not to take away from Apple's Thunder, but if you haven't tried Amazon's service give it a whirl. Higher quality, DRM free and pricing is competitive. It's not as rich of an experience as browsing through the iTunes store, but you're not locked into hardware.</p>
<p>I'll never switch from Apple products anyways so I guess it doesn't really matter for me. Although it IS nice to play my music through the XBox 360 during video games. Anyways, I digress.</p>
