    will big media try to embrace NEW ideas instead of resurrecting the old ones?\"\r\n\r\nI
    whole-heartedly agree. I'm so sick of remakes, sequels, etc. Where is the originality?!"

  content: Thanks Jennifer! It looks like we'll have to turn to the Internet for original
    stuff these days. But then we suffer from shoestring budgets. But hey..it's a
    start right?

<p><img src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/images/gladiators.gif" border="1" class="right" height=112 width=132> Now don't get me wrong. I loved me some Diamond growing up as a kid. But American Gladiators coming back? Hasn't the world moved on?</p>
<p>It looks like they'll be taking a slightly different twist to the show, following contestants as they train as well as the actual events. All of the events will be upgraded for modern day but I'm not sure that I care. </p>
<p>When will big media try to embrace <b>NEW</b> ideas instead of resurrecting the old ones? Maybe Hollywood needs to figure out new ways to recruit talent and ideas. I doubt seriously that nobody out there has an original idea. Maybe NBC needs some kind of open house.</p>
