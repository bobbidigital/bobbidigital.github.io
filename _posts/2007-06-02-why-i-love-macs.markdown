  content: "I'm starting to hear more comments like that, folks glad they switched
    to the Mac.  Well, welcome to the club.  It was awful tough back in the dark days
    down in the valley (about 91-99, really), but now we're on the mountaintop.\r\n\r\nI've
    been using Macs since the beginning (spring 1984), so there were a lot of unfulfilled
    hopes.  After Jobs came back and I first saw the original iMac, my immediate thought
    was, \"this is the Mac we were hoping for back in 1986\".\r\n\r\nOf course the
    iMac had a LOT more power and connectivity than a 1986 machine would have, but
    the basic all-in-one color Mac follow-on to the original monochrome Mac 128/512
    never appeared, even though many designs were rumoured to be prototyped at Apple.\r\n\r\nInstead,
    Apple delayed and finally brought out the Mac II in April 87, clearly a step in
    the wrong design direction that it took over a decade to correct.\r\n\r\nI just
    hope Apple doesn't crack up again whenever Jobs steps away.  His remark at the
    end of the Jobs/Gates interview the other day seemed a bit cryptic and troubling.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    you might want to see my own views on the Mac: <a href=\"http://allthings.blogsome.com/2006/03/27/my-own-ten-peeves-about-the-mac/\"

<p><img src="images/Apple-logo.jpg" height="187" width="226" border="2" class="right">It's really quite simple. Stability and performance. Period. I'm sitting here doing a bunch of web stuff. I've got Photoshop CS2 open, AIM, Twitterific, Transmit, 17 Firefox windows, BBEdit, iTunes(playing and syncing to AppleTV) and I'm ripping a DVD with Handbrake. ZERO lag. Things are just moving along nice and smooth. No juttery windows when I drag them, no 30 minute delay between switching windows. Just straight up smoothness. God I'm glad I switched.</p>
<p>p.s. I also have XCode running. (But not compiling anything)</p>
