<p>I thought this was a pretty neat little website.  It allows you to search for particular strings in code. I would imagine the code needs to be open source. Check it out! <a target="_blank" href="http://www.koders.com">http://www.koders.com</a></p>
<p>Also this add-on for Firefox (because you're all using Firefox <strong>RIGHT!</strong>) lets you randomly select websites from several categories you can choose from. I've played around with it and have found some very interesting sites. Download it at <a target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/138/">https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/138/</a></p>
