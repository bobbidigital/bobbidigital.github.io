<p><img width="314" height="243" align="left" src="http://www.mikeshardware.com/reviews/itunes4windows/itunes-scrn.jpg" />So I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve spent the last few days categorizing and rating my music in my iTunes Library. Now doing this exercise has many benefits. The main benefit that I hope to receive is the downright exploitation of Smart Playlists. Poking around with Smart Playlists (and Smart Folders for you Mac users out there) revealed a world of absolute power over your iTunes library. But that part comes later, first it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the actual process of rating.</p>
<p>Now some people don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t even know that you can rate your music in iTunes, or they think it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a silly thing to do. Let me tell you something, go through all the options of a smart playlists and the chances for improvement will quickly begin to open up. But for now lets stick with the quick returns of ratings.</p>
<p>1)&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; &Acirc;&nbsp;You find SO much shit that you didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t realize you had in your library. Some for the better and some for the worse, but either way you have a better understanding. I found so many gems and so many downright stinkers rating my library it was amazing.<br />
2)&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; &Acirc;&nbsp;Saving space. Because once you find the crap, its much much easier to actually get rid of it. Once you rate your entire library (all 1700 songs in my case) sort by ratings. Then quickly ask yourself why you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re holding on to those songs with a rating of 1.&Acirc;&nbsp; I bet you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll be able to dump at least 15% of your library. You don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t intend to buy shit music, but every now and then you have a lapse in judgment. We&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve all done it so don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be ashamed.<br />
3)&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; &Acirc;&nbsp;You can now easily find songs that you really like. Sometimes shuffle can be a pain in the ass because of those duds we just got deleting in step 2. Now you can enjoy your listening experience.</p>
<p>In reality we haven&acirc;&euro;&trade;t even gotten to the cool part yet. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll do that in my next post. The other thing your going to want to do is take a look at your genres. The iTunes Music Store has so many classifications for music no song could ever belong to the same genre of another song. Some people like that. Personally I loathe it. So I broke my songs into a few basic categories. Rap, R&B, Rock, Metal, Classical, Folk, Pop, Holiday, Techno.&Acirc;&nbsp; That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s it. No alternative, no emo/rock, no electronica, no trance, just broad strokes of music. Some of you prefer the highly detailed classifications and depending on your listening patterns that may or may not work for you. But whatever you do make sure every song is filed in its appropriate genre.</p>
<p>Now that we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve rated and classified our music we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re ready to start creating some smart playlists and really start enjoying our music library.</p>
