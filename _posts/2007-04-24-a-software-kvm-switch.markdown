<p><a href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Synergy </a>is a product that aims to give you the flexibility of a KVM switch without the hassle of the wires and extra extension cables. But what's required of the software to me kind of defeats the point.</p>
<p>A KVM switch is used to control multiple PC's with a single keyboard, mouse and monitor. You simply have to choose which is the active setup at the moment. Synergy fixes this through software through a server-client setup. A single machine acts as the server while your other machines serve as the clients. The server is who's monitor, keyboard and mouse will be used.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this is really a practical solution or not. I'd rather have the cables than a spare machine personally. The one upside is that the software is free vs. whatever the going rate for KVMs are these days.</p>
<p>If you're interested the software can be found on the source forge site. <a href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Synergy</a></p>
