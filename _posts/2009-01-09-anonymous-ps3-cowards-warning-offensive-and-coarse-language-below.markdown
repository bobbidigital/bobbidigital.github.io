  content: "I've had the exact same experiences on XBOX Live. (Except for the crappy
    Server bit) It too annoys me because a lot of these people are young children
    or young adults. I would think that we are becoming more racially tolerant, but
    the new generation of gamers and online flamers make me think otherwise. In fact
    it makes me think things will be getting worse.\r\n\r\nIt seems like racism could
    be staging a comeback. It's become less socially acceptable to be a racist and
    a bigot. But when you can hide behind the anonymity of the Internet I think people's
    true colors begin to shine. And we're not talking about occasional usage of the
    \"N\" word here. We're talking about people hurling it in a purely offensive manner.
    \r\n\r\nI wish I could say it was a one time occurrence, but every time I've ever
    been online and in the general chat I hear these types of things go on. Sad sad
    thing man."

  content: It makes me sad and angry hearing how hateful people can be. I'm not saying
    we all need to be singing kumbaya with flat cokes being passed around but I would
    like to think an universal adage of "Live simply so others might simply live"
    should be emphasized. The Golden Rule doesn't exist in the mainstream. I wish
    the hateful racists of the world had one face so I could slap the shit out if.

  content: "As a white male, I'll admit that I feel somewhat uncomfortable joining
    this discussion.  I obviously don't know how it feels to be personally discriminated
    against because of the color of my skin, but I would like to think that in an
    ideal world, that doesn't make my point of view any less valid.\r\n\r\nI disagree
    with the possibility that \"racism could be staging a comeback\", as Jeff stated,
    mostly because I don't think that racism at this level was ever really gone to
    begin with, and I don't think that it's this level of racism that really matters.\r\n\r\nYou're
    never going to hear me say that racism is acceptable, in any way, shape or form.
    \ But this isn't your parents or your grandparents racism.  This is an ignorant
    punk hiding behind the anonymity of the internet and doing his damndest to get
    a rise out of people.  Log onto PSN or XBL, and there's going to be some schmuck
    holding down the transmit button and repeating some racial or cultural slur, be
    it nigger, jew, fag, queer, what have you.  I don't think half of the little shits
    know what they're actually saying, they're just parroting what they've been told
    is offensive by older generations and trying to bully anyone who's unfortunate
    enough to have to listen.\r\n\r\nAs I write this, I'm consciously aware of how
    my point of view must sound.  I'm not saying that people should have to accept
    it, or that they should be happy that things aren't like they used to be in the
    50's or 60's.  All I'm saying is that DeltaDawne86 and his ilk aren't the harbingers
    of Racist American in 2009; he's just an ignorant little shit playing a video
    game on an inferior console.\r\n\r\n...oh yeah, I went there."

  content: "Your point is no less valid because my point is that we are people who
    have had different upbringings, different experiences, different thoughts, etc.
    That's the beauty of life and all its forms. I just needed to get this off my
    chest rather than just swallow it done like a shit-flavored Popsicle. \r\n\r\nAnd
    we're really going to go into the whole 360 vs PS3 debate? Sony and M$ both made
    awesome consoles that both have their share of pros and cons. Nothing's perfect,
    just like people. And playing Divx on PS3 is just awesome (flash drive to console.
    Play. Enjoy.) The next step? TVersity!"

  content: You'll get no debate out of me, as it would smack of fanboyism, and my
    time with the PS3 has been nil.  Just trying to add a little levity to the situation.

<p>I love playing video games especially online with other people. It is a cathartic release, it is therapeutic, and when you play on a large HDTV, heavenly. Nothing beats getting a few of your buddies together for a little ass-kicking and name taking. There isn't anything about online playing that I hate in particular with a few exceptions; cultural/racial insults.</p>
<p>Last night, my best man/downstairs neighbor and I were playing Team Deathmatch on Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare for PS3. After waiting several moments for Sony's crappy-ass servers to connect us to an open match, we finally entered a game. To my chagrin, a thin, nasally suburban waste of sperm and egg who calls himself DeltaDawne86 was spouting, "NiggerNiggerNiggerNigger" over and over again. I hoped to God this punk wouldn't be on our team so I could pump round after round of virtual lead into this ignoramus' skull but not this time. He was on our team. I should have just muted him and been done with it but I didn't. My mistake.</p>
<p>The next words out of this renaissance ass were directed to my teammate and neighbor. "I bet Play2Ruff is a nigger." I lost it.</p>
<p>"If you ever met him, he would fuckin' eat you!" His response to me? "You must be a nigger too. Shut up nigger, it isn't nigger-talk time, it's nigger-shut-up time! You talk when I say talk!" Now, I am a peaceful person and am just as tolerant of people's idiosyncrasies and idiocy but hiding behind the anonymity of the Internet to insult someone with such vitriol and ignorance pissed me off. I replied, "Sure, hide behind your anonymity and say what you want. I wish you could say that shit to me in person." He continued his racist rants and as my friend retorted with insults back, I said, "I'm not tolerating this bullshit. I'm out." and disconnected.</p>
<p>My wife looked at me and said, "It's only a game, honey." She couldn't hear what this inbred SOB was saying since it went to my earpiece so I explained what happened and she sat there stunned. "Why are people such assholes?" A question that I am still asking myself this morning. And to hear people state, "Look at the new President-Elect. This nation isn't racist." I beg to differ. Deep rooted racism exists even in the virtual world where no one knows your name.</p>
<p>The online gaming community is not a soapbox for political discourse, racial name-calling, prejudice, or ignorance. It is a place for like-minded people to enjoy playing games together as a COMMUNITY. It is not a klan rally, a call for Jihad, or racial cleansing. Dirty dozens, I can handle, ignorance and hate, I cannot. Grow a pair you punks. Peace all.</p>
