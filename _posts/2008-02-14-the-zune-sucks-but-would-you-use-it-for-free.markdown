<p>Turns out Microsoft is still having trouble getting their Zunes out the door. As part of a Valentines day promotion they guaranteed delivery in time for the big lovers day. Unfortunately their manufacturing plants weren't on board with that and they're not capable of completing all the orders.</p>
<p>BUT, check out this note below from a Microsoft e-mail.</p>
<blockquote><p>We wanted to provide you with an update on your order status. Due to some issues in our fulfillment center there remains a chance we will miss getting your Zune to you by February 14th. We are working hard to get your order to you as quickly as possible and we currently plan to ship your Zune within the next 3-4 days. Once your order is in transit, we will send you a shipping confirmation with a link for tracking.</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide a smooth customer experience for ordering, customization, and delivery. We sincerely apologize for not meeting that goal in this specific case. We will be refunding the entire amount of your order, which you should be able to see on your credit/debit card within 7-10 days. We hope you love your Zune and that you will accept our sincere apology.</p>
<p>If you have additional questions, please call 1.877.GET.ZUNE. For fastest service, press 5 then press 1 and have your order information ready.</p>
<p>The Zune Originals Team<br />

<p>Sounds like someone is DESPERATE for market share. FYI Microsoft. If you're sending me some free shit, I'll definitely check it out.</p>
