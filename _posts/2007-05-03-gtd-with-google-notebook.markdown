<p><img src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/images/googlenotebook.jpg" height="254" width="254"  class="left">Our boys at <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/geek-to-live/getting-things-done-with-google-notebook-256844.php">Life Hacker</a> have a pretty good write up on how to implement GTD using Google Notebook. I've been trying to find a good, practical, useful purpose for Google Notebook. I even went as far as to put it on my Google homepage. </p>
<p>And there it sat. For a long time. Doing nothing. Wait no, I did put a web link in there once, but then I remembered that's why I have del.ico.us.  So I removed it all together. Either way, check out the article. It probably doesn't suck.</p>
