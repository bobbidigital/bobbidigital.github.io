  content: To be honest, I don&#39;t generally try to visualize hit points that much.
    As a DM, it&#39;s fun to describe the action of getting hit and all that, especially
    when you do it. But yeah, hit points and effects of getting hit are one of those
    things that I don&#39;t try to visualize or try to incorporate into gaming too
    much. People have plenty of trouble just trying to keep up with the basic game
    mechanics!

  content: I think it is the DM&#39;s job to paint a picture of how NPC&#39;s and
    monsters react to the blows and misses of the players. And I think the DM should
    also add some flavor in the form of a drop in initiative or an attack penalty
    when players make critical hits or monsters/NPC&#39;s are close to incapacitation.<br><br>In
    the end the players are responsible for their own perception of the game, but
    it is the DM who paints the picture of each encounter. DM&#39;s should feel add
    their own strokes to the structure provided by the rules.

<p>One of the biggest problems with combat in the Dungeons and Dragons game was the mental visualization of combat. Characters have an immense amount of hit points, which allows them to take large amounts of damage. In our mind's eye, we tend to think of the combat as these large blows that are exchanged back and forth. But when attempting to add a sense of reality to the game, we know these visions can't possibly make sense.</p>
<p>How can a fighter take a battle axe to the face for 22 points of damage and stay fighting, but then suddenly collapses when the bard hits him with a dagger for 2 points of damage. It's really all about timing, but makes for a difficult time describing the action. Since the launch of 3rd edition, the gaming community has been pretty vocal in expressing the viewpoint of combat being a series of faints and jabs, with a killing blow being a one-time occasion. This line of thought works well until someone scores a critical hit. The idea of a critical hit is that massive amounts of damage have just been inflicted, but describing it as a "glancing blow" takes some of the excitement out of the ever elusive "nat 20".</p>
<p>Part of this is our long standing thought around "hit points". It even has the word "hit" in it, which gives us an image of blasting through someone's defenses and smashing them in the mouth for damage. THe introduction of 4th edition further muddied the waters by introducing the "Bloodied" status, which means you're at half your maximum hit points. In reality you're not really "bloodied" though are you? Going on WotC's description of combat being a series of faints and blows, wouldn't it be more accurate to simply rename hit points to something like "defense points". I know it's a simple change but the power of the mind's preconceptions on something can have a huge impact in the way people envision it.</p>
<p>Imagine now that these "defense points" describe's someone's remaining strength to defend against attacks. Hard blows are even harder to parry. As you joust back and forth your opponents defenses weaken. Each character could have a small number of <em>true</em> hit points, lets say no more than 10 or 15. These points represent those true fatal blows that make contact with the enemy. That way people know when an opponent is truly getting near the end. The back and forth of the combat now has ore context.</p>
<p>The rule system could be very easy to implement as well. You simply subtract 10 or 15 from each player's total hit points. The new number becomes your "defense points" while the 10 or 15 you subtracted becomes your new hit point value. For the sake of our mind we can rename "Bloodied" to "Exhausted". I know these seem like minor changes, but when you're playing a fantasy game, how your mind perceives and interprets things is of the upmost important. How many times have you been in a D&D game when someone lays a really awesome critical hit down, but then is bummed that no additional effects were incurred or that the target didn't reel back in total agony?</p>
<p>That's because your players have a specific vision of what a "hit" against "hit points" looks like. Changing the terminology might be an easy fix to making the visualization of combat easier.</p>
