<blockquote><a href="http://www.ifmagazine.com/new.asp?article=6571">IF Magazine</a> talked with veteran producer <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0831098/"><strong>Erwin Stoff</strong></a> (via <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/37584">AICN</a>) and discovered that he's working on making a live-action <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> movie with Fox. Apparently it's very fresh news: "I'm really excited to be working on it, and it's in the really early stages. We just signed it the other day." If you're not so familiar with <em>Bebop</em>, it's an incredibly popular Japanese anime TV series that first aired back in 1998 and has become a hit here in the US as well as Japan. I'm not exactly a big fan myself, but considering Hollywood is caught up in the anime trend, I'm definitely excited to see this one come to life as well.</blockquote><br />
There's an exclamation point at the end but I'm not sure if I should be excited yet.&Acirc;&nbsp; Maybe it's because I'm not sure on anime translations just yet. Lots of annoucements for other products, but I don't think I've seen a translation done yet. (Good or bad)</p>
<p>It's a good series and is probably one of the better choices they could have made for an adaptation.</p>
