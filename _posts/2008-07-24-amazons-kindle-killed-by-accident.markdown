excerpt: "Meredith Yoest wakes up every morning and follows a routine. She showers,
  gets dressed, applies makeup, has breakfast and is finally out the door to begin
  her 30 minute commute to work. Meredith is one of millions of people who follow
  this exact same process all over the city of Chicago. A 30 minute commute is something
  that at least half of us in America can relate to.\r\n\r\nThat 30 minute commute
  can be pretty boring for Meredith without something to do. Normally she brings a
  book to read, but today in her mad dash to get out the door, she only remembered
  to grab her purse and cell phone on the way out. She doesn't miss the book until
  she's on the bus staring at advertisements in an attempt to avoid long bouts of
  eye contact with other passengers. This same thing happens\r\nto me (and probably
  you too) about 1 or 2 times a week. At least until a couple of weeks ago. I've solved
  this problem.\r\n\r\n"

<p>Meredith Yoest wakes up every morning and follows a routine. She showers, gets dressed, applies makeup, has breakfast and is finally out the door to begin her 30 minute commute to work. Meredith is one of millions of people who follow this exact same process all over the city of Chicago. A 30 minute commute is something that at least half of us in America can relate to.</p>

to me (and probably you too) about 1 or 2 times a week. At least until a couple of weeks ago. I've solved this problem.</p>

<p>Amazon launched a revolutionary product called "The Kindle", an e-book reader capable of holding over 200 titles at a time. The device landed with mixed reviews. Notable drawbacks were the devices aesthetic appeal, size and a $400 dollar price tag. The Kindle was intended to be a game changer for Amazon and whether they've succeeded or not is still up for review. But what has been decided (at least in this blogger's opinion) is that Apple has fixed all of the problems of the Kindle and delivered an excellent e-book reader. The best part is, they didn't even try to do it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ereader.com" target="_blank">eReader.com</a> has developed a native iPhone application simply named eReader. This unassuming application however has transformed my iPhone yet again into a must have device. The beautiful screen of the iPhone is perfect for reading books. You may look and think "No way I could read a book on that thing." You'd be surprised. The approach is fairly simple. The font size is roughly the same size you expect on a regular<br />
paperback book, the only difference being that the pages are now smaller. Thanks to the iPhone's storage capacity you can easily fit 10 books on the iPhone. (Actually you can fit much more, but in reality who needs more than 10 books at a time?)</p>
<p>The layout works incredibly well for fiction titles. To move to the next page is a swift swiping gesture across the face of the device. Make the same motion in the other direction to go backwards. A hidden navigation bar at the bottom of the application activates when you touch the area, allowing you to skip chapters, see the table of contents or change the font size of the pages. The eReader application automatically saves the page that you last read, getting rid of the need for clumsy bookmark type substitutes. You open eReader and your at the page you left off at. Simple. It even has a progress bar which tells you how far along in the book you are.</p>
<p>What I love most about it is that it's on my phone, the one device that I will undoubtedly always have with me. This means I also have access to my reading all the time. Doctor's office? Commuter train? Quick lunch alone? You don't have to THINK about bringing your reading entertainment because it's right in your pocket! It's saved me countless times during periods of severe boredom. Not to mention you tend to read books a lot quicker because you're reading more often!</p>
<p>Now all those book lovers out there are going to say the same 2 things.</p>
<p>1. "Some books are DRM, so I can't share it with a friend."&Acirc;&nbsp; -- Yes this is true. Some premium books (the definition of premium in regards to titles is unknown to me) require DRM which prevents you from sharing the book with others. But keep in mind how many classics are part of the public domain now!<br />
These books are freely downloadable! You've got instant access to thousands of literary classics and they won't cost you a cent!</p>
<p>2. "There's something I love about having the physical book and flipping through the pages. The experience is different" -- Isn't this the argument anytime a medium evolves? It's all about trade-offs in my opinion. The theater experience is more immerse than the experience found when viewing a DVD at home. People still opt to watch movies at home though because it's cheaper and more convenient for them. Sure the experience is different, but it's not lost by any means.</p>
<p>I love the convenience of always having several reading options with me at all times. There are some caveats of course. I truly only use the eReader for fiction. Any book that I may use as reference material once I'm done with it is instantly removed as an eReader option. In those cases there literally are just too many advantages to having a physical copy of the work. (Underlining, highlighting, etc) The other shortcoming of course is the vain act of putting the finished book on your bookshelf to display to your visitors how well read you are. I make light of this but to some it is a real sense of accomplishment, something to take pride in. I'm sure nobody will truly appreciate your e-book collection, even if you do have an online service such<br />
as <a href="http://www.shelfari.com">Shelfari</a></p>
<p>I think that eReader is hands down my most useful iPhone application to date. I can use it without a cell signal or Wifi and it truly enhances my life as opposed to giving me another mindless way to waste time. I started to demo it with a copy of <em>Last of the Mohicans</em> and was instantly hooked. That's not to say that I think eReader is the BEST eBook reader out there. It's the only one I've tried and it does everything I need it to do.</p>
<p>I guess my point more succintly is that the iPhone very well may have killed the Kindle by accident.</p>
