<p>Sony is simply out of control. Anyone who knows anything about consoles knows that it doesn't matter how much you put in the box. If you can't sleep with it or it doesn't dispense alcohol, then your core audience isn't going to pay top dollar for a video game console unless you have some solid content, i.e. GAMES. </p>
<p>So then why would Sony even consider making the barrier to entry so large for developers to get on board with their console.&nbsp; Sony has slashed the developer kit in HALF so that it's a nice round figure of $10,250 dollars. That's just for the DEVELOPMENT KIT!!!&nbsp; And that's HALF of what it was a few weeks ago.&nbsp; Word on the street is the XBox 360 development kit was going for around $2,000 dollars and the Wii Kit a little less than that.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So IMHO this is a good move for Sony, but probably not good enough.</p>
