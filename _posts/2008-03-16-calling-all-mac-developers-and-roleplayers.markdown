<p>I'm not sure how many Mac users out there are D&D gamers ore any type of roleplaying for that matter. But if you're out there and you're reading this please answer one plea for me. There is a definitive lack of RPG tools out there for the Mac. (Or my Google skills are really suspect)</p>
<p>With a rapid adoption of Macs by geeks I can't help but think that the geek populace will soon follow. But where are the tools we need to help manage our game sessions? Track characters? Map worlds? There are a handful of tools none of which can hold a candle to their PC counterparts. The idea that I have to soil my new Macbook Pro with a copy of Windows JUST so I can use good tools hurts me to the core.</p>
<p>I'm in the early stages of developing a character generator/storage system for the iPhone, which unfortunately will be web based. (There are reasons behind this. The SDK does seem cool though) After which I THINK I'm going to try to tackle some time of DM's manager tool. But I haven't done a lot of Objective-C stuff so the learning curve might take me awhile. I could write it in Java, but that takes away the Mac feel.</p>
<p>So if you're a developer out there and you need/want a project to work on I can help get you started. You could call me a creative consultant or something. Even if we start basic, it's a start. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nuketown.com">Nuketown</a> has a list of <a href="http://www.nuketown.com/features/macrpg">mac tools</a> at their site.</p>
<p>It seems like the number one problem with all of the apps I've seen so far is there organization of information. D&D has a LOT of information to throw at a player. (actually most RPG's do. Except maybe Marvel) Organizing that information is difficult to present a Mac style application. It's not an easy task, but I think cracking that puzzle will be the difference maker.</p>
