<p>How come I haven't seen a Top Programmer reality TV Show? You have the top software developers come together for an elimination style programming face-off? This could be HOT HOT HOT! I know I've got some Hollywood producers reading this blog. MAKE IT HAPPEN!!</p>
<p>We could call it, "The High Order Bit" or "Top Dork" Come on!! This could be awesome! Who's up for it!?!?</p>
