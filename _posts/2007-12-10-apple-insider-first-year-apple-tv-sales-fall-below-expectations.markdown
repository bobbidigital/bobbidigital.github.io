Could that be because it was poorly marketed? Every time I tell someone I have an Apple TV, they think it's an actual television set. Apple really released this product and then just decided "Well...we don't really want to push this." The product is spectacular! Yes it does have some faults, most notably a lack of DivX support. But let me ask a general question. Who sells Videos in Divx? Divx is the platform choice of pirates and porn fans. I don't think I've ever seen a digital download store that sells DivX movies. So I can almost forgive that transgression.</p>
<p>I guess part of the problem is the lack of support from the film industry, lack of HD content and the relative time it takes to download a film. I've only purchased one movie from the iTunes store (Cars) and the quality was fantastic. I do miss Dolby 5.1 however I hear that the AppleTV does in fact have the hardware to support 5.1. Why it's not enabled is a mystery to me. </p>
<p>A price cut probably wouldn't hurt the device either. $300 bucks makes the barrier to entry limited mostly to early adopters or just general techno-philes. I dunno, I just hope Apple doesn't put it on the chopping block. It could use another software update sometime. </p>
