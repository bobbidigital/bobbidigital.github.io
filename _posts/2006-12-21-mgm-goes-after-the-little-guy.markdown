  content: "i don't think i have a problem with squatting. in fact, i reject the term
    outright. squatting is when you hang out somewhere you don't belong because it's
    not being used or is under-used. web squatting is more akin to the real estate
    business. these people had a little foresight and made an investment. that's called
    capitalism, isn't it?\r\n\r\nof course, that probably doesn't have anything to
    do with this case. most likely he's using the website legitimatey, and as you
    say he's going to get unfairly runoft by the deeper pockets."

<p>A fellow blogger and online store owner is in a dispute with some heavy hitters. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/news/3095/my-battle-mgm-over-wargamescom#">MGM studios is going after Rogers Cadenhead </a>for the domain <a target="_blank" href="http://www.allthingsdork.com/www.wargames.com">www.wargames.com.</a></p>
<p>The guy has legally owned and operated under that domain since 1998 to sell war based board games such as Axies and Allies. (One of my personal favorites might I add) Rumor has it MGM is working on a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0865957/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxxPVdhciBHYW1lc3xteD0yMHxsbT01MDB8aHRtbD0x;fc=5;ft=20;fm=1">sequel</a> to War Games, which is probably why after all this time they're going after Cadenhead. (War Games was released in 1983)</p>
<p>The typical order of business here is to inundate the little guy with legal fees for court apperances, documents services etc. Keep pounding him until the well is dry and then walk off victorious. I'm sure Rogers does well but I doubt he can keep up with the check book flex of MGM. Now I'm not in favor of squatting, but if this guy is using it for a completely legitimate purpose the only thing I can think to say is to hell with MGM. I'm going to write this guy and see if he has a donation defense fund setup. Hopefully together we'll be able to make enough of a stink to make MGM think twice. I doubt it, but we sure as hell can try.</p>
