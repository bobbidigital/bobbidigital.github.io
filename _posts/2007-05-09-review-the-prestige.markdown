<p><img src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/images/prestige.jpg" border="2" height="154" width="100" class="left">The Prestige was by far one of the better movies I've seen this year. Now I know it's not exactly new, but some of us don't get out to the theaters as often as we'd like. But for a DVD rental this movie will blow your mind.</p>
<p>The Prestige is the story of two aspiring, yet competing magicians who become hell bent with the downfall of one another. Playing on two of my favorite sins, envy and wrath, the two magicians, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale fight to discover the secrets to the illusions that eventually make them both famous.</p>
<p>The characters for these two are very well written and spectacularly performed by both Bale and Jackman. Christian Bale doesn't make too far of a stretch from the character we're used to seeing him play, but he still does a damn good job with it. Jackman is also strong, showing us he's much more than a regenerating heart throb.</p>
<p>The themes of the story are simple, obsession, envy and a touch of pure greed. Alfred Borden (Bale) is on trial for the murder of Robert Angier (Jackman) which took place during one of Angier's shows. Borden is accused of placing a water filled tank underneath a trap door of the stage and watching Angier drown. This turns out to be the end of a series of escalating conflicts between the two magicians over the years.</p>
<p>The story is told primarily through flashbacks which works particularly well for this story. The transitions from past to present and vice vera our seamless due to the circumstances of the characters. So as an audience member you never feel lost as you do in poorly crafted flashback scenes. To support the flashbacks there is some mild narration which come to us in the form of diary entries being read. Again this works because it helps to set the stage of the action in the scene to come.</p>
<p>You know I hate to spoil a good movie, so again I won't go into much detail. Just know that the conflict between Angier and Borden is top notch as well as the acting. There were also some noteworthy performances given by Michael Caine and David Bowie as Tesla. (Yes THE Tesla...and he's awesome) Scarlett Johansson you ask? She's easy on the eyes, but the reality of it is her role in the film as well as her performance was overshadowed by the depth of Jackman and Bale.</p>
<p>Rent the movie, by the movie, download the movie. Get it somehow and view it as soon as you can. And remember, "Watch Closely"....</p>
