<p>It's Wednesday and you know what that means. New comics! I'm really interested in this Wolverine: Prodigal Son book.&Acirc;&nbsp; In case you haven't heard (because you live under a rock) or you're not that into comics, Wolverine: Prodigal Son is a reimagining of the Wolverine character origin, but told in the style of Manga comics. It should be really interesting. Word on the street is they're going to do a similar run with the X-Men.</p>
<p>This book is volume 1 of 2 with others possibly coming out depending on its success.</p>
