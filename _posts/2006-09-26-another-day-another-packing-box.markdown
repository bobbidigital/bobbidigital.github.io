<p><img align="left" title="packing time" alt="packing time" src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/images/moving-boxes.gif" />I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve come to terms with something. The next time I move, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m just going to burn the place down. You find so much shit when you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re trying to clean the place out. I found a box of 5 &Acirc;&frac14; inch floppy drives. When the hell did I EVER have a 5 &Acirc;&frac14; inch floppy drive?</p>
<p>So the move is almost done. The desk is broken down and the computer is already at Steph&acirc;&euro;&trade;s. The last move will be the transfer of Road Runner to her apartment.</p>
<p>The film is coming along good. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve got a rough cut assembled and so far it looks promising. I still have a few shots to pick up just to give those finishing touches. The cast was pretty damn good. Everyone thinks Carl was absolutely perfect for the role. I hope to have it done before the <a title="UI Party Postcard" target="_blank" href="http://www.upstateindependents.com/downloads/ui_fullcard.jpg">UI Party. </a></p>
<p>Speaking of UI I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m hoping that the party is a success. The closer it gets the more nervous I get. <a title="Eric's Profile" target="_blank" href="http://www.myspace.com/35538074">Eric</a> and <a target="_blank" title="Kevin's MySpace page" href="http://www.myspace.com/mobetta_films">Kevin</a> are doing a tremendous job with putting it together and they assure me I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve got nothing to worry about. Of course I can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t help but think about the worse case scenario. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m still very excited to be taking over. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve got some great ideas and I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m looking forward to pitching them to the group. Just seems like I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve got SO many ideas and can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t keep them all-straight. I need to start back full time onto my GTD regiment. Ok, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve gotta get ready for work.</p>
