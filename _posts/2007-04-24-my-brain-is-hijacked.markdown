So I thought I'd lull myself to sleep on the Information Super Highway. What I got instead was a harsh slap in the face by a man I like to call, Mr. Reality.</p>
<p>I was over at the <a href="http://www.43folders.com" target="_blank">43 Folders</a> site (You don't know it? GO TO IT!!) and Merlin had a post about a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/weekinreview/22richtel.html?pagewanted=print" target="_blank">New York Times article</a> in regards to the Blackberry outage last week sometime. A few lines rang out to me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">&acirc;&euro;&oelig;It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s random reinforcement,&acirc;&euro; Mr. Katz said. The fact that you don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know when important news will come, he said, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;means you will quickly engage in obsessive compulsive behavior.&acirc;&euro;</p></p>
<p align="left"> Several years ago, Mr. Ratey began using the term &acirc;&euro;&oelig;acquired attention deficit disorder&acirc;&euro; to describe the condition of people who are accustomed to a constant stream of digital stimulation and feel bored in the absence of it. Regardless of whether the stimulation is from the Internet, TV or a cellphone, the brain, he said, is hijacked.</p><br />
</blockquote><br />
That's me. It describes me to a tee. I've never really thought of myself as addicted to information. The fact that you could be never really quite occurred. But as I go through my behavioral patterns the stark truth is there.</p>
<p>Today I was rearranging my workspace at the office. (They're letting me use my Mac again! Different story though) I had to move one PC out of my slice of cube paradise due to space constraints. But this PC serves a very important function. It runs the Sprint Business Connect Software to forward my work e-mail to my Treo. Is anyone expecting me to be available 24x7? No. But I need to be, for no other reason than I like being on top of the information and changes in our environment.</p>
<p>I check mail CONSTANTLY all day every day. Work, personal you name it I check it. The best part is a lot of times I may not respond because I just don't have the time or energy at that point. So why the hell do I have to check it? Because my brain requires that kind of stimulus at all times. With mobile versions of everything it just further perpetuates this need and I buy into it every time.</p>
<p>Thank you Merlin and thank you NYT. I know something more about myself...even though I don't understand it. I have to go check Google Reader now.</p>
