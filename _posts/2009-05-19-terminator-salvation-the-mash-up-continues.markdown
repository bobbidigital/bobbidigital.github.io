<p>Last night, a group of us were able to see a promo of McG's (McLoving's long forgotten cousin) Terminator: Salvation, a reboot-continuation of the James Cameron classic. As we waited in anticipation, the lights came on and a middle aged man announced that cellphones need to be on vibrate yet if any of these cameras are seen pointing at the screen, you will be asked to leave and most likely be facing a felony charge. Yikes. Good thing I just brought my regular spy cam. Just kidding. No really, I am.</p>
<p>After watching the shitastic trailer of The Hangover (a comedy trailer before a sci-fi flick? Cmon!), the Halycon Company splash appeared and the fun began. And I will place a serious emphasis on FUN. Yes, this is a good Terminator movie. This isn't a groundbreaking entry to the canon yet it does continue the struggle between man and machine with great fanfare and lots of explosions. And surprisingly enough, a little romance without all the 'Let's have sex like there's no tomorrow because you know, there may not be'. That was offscreen as evidenced by Kate Connor's expanding belly. Thanks for sparing us that.</p>
<p>Sam Worthington opens the film as Marcus Wright, a convict on death row, who is being convinced to donate his body to science by Helena Bonham Carter who is looking a little scary as a cancer-stricken scientist.&Acirc;&nbsp; She tells him that it is a way to save the human race and Marcus sells her his body for a kiss from her. "That's what death tastes like." Is that a not-so-subtle way of saying, "Damn your breath is funky?" Queue unintentional humor list, now. Fast forward to 2018 where John Connor and his team infiltrate a SkyNet facility in a land that looks like Mad Max's backyard. John Connor is the only survivor of this expedition and here we are introduced to Terry Crews' dead body. Yep, one shot of our man Terry laying dead. He didn't even have a chance to do the robot. Unintentional humor again. And it doesn't end there.</p>
<p>After the destruction of the facility, we see Marcus Wright again this time screaming the primal scream of a man reborn. And looking exactly the same as when he was executed. Hmmm. Not like the trailers hid the twist involving Marcus but I am not spoiling that here.&Acirc;&nbsp; What I will say is that this movie is a huge funny yet enjoyable mess. It is entertaining, loud, and never drags but one has to wonder; when will this war end? Why aren't they dealing in collapsed timelines rather than band-aiding a single continuum that can seemingly collapse on itself and wipe out the entire human universe? I digress because what can you expect from someone that made Charlies Angels?</p>
<p>But I have to say that the single worse part of the entire film was Ahnuld's 'cameo' appearance; a piss poor CGI-rendering of his face on Roland Kickapoo's chiseled body (I'm sorry but Ahnuld was not THAT damned big). A T-800 Halloween mask on Quinton Jackson would have worked better. Honestly, how can one spend $150 million plus on a popcorn flick and not have decent CGI-rendering? Anthony Hopkins looked better in Red Dragon! Oh and there was one other scene where John Connor sneaks into SkyNet just as a Terminator sentry approaches. The Terminator seemingly looks around as though it heard something then it looks as if it shrugs its shoulders and continues on its way. I couldn't refrain from laughing at that as several critics turned around and sneered at me. Sorry, I found it funny.</p>
<p>All in all, T4 is not a terrible movie (for that, see S. Darko, Dragonball Z: Evolutions, or Push) even with the unintentional laughs (after you see the film, you'll understand why I have the Tin Man photo above), comparisons to Mad Max's apocalyptic geography, Ahnuld's terrible CGI-face, and Terry Crews' wicked brief appearance, it was a good time. Don't expect it to break any new ground or explain how Kate went from a veterinarian to a physician (probably archives of Wiki) but do expect to enjoy the introduction of some new Terminators and some throwback scenes that seemed to have been ripped from the previous three films. Have fun. I'm seeing Star Trek tomorrow. IMAX stylee. YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!</p>
