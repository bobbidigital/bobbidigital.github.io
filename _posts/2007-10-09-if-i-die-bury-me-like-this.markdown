<p><img src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/images/StarTrekCasket.jpg" border="1" height="140" width="200" class="left"> This is by far one of the single greatest things I've ever seen. <a href="http://www.eternalimage.net/st_page.html">Eternal Images</a> has put together the  greatest gift a dead man could want, a Star Trek torpedo style casket.  I've never been so excited to get old. </p>
<p>Modeled after the torpedo Spock was launched in during Star Trek II: Wrath of Kahn. Now I just need to find my original series film uniform. They also have a very stylized Urn which I'm not much of a fan of.</p>
<p>Big ups to <a href="http://snafu-ed.blogspot.com/2007/10/star-trek-line-of-funeral-products.html"> SNAFU-ed</a> for posting this.</p>
