    &amp; photos as it doesn't need to be on the hard-drive.\r\n\r\nGreat to finally
    see HD on my TV (too poor for Blu-ray and I thinik it might be dead after this)
    but we need HD TV shows &amp; movies ASAP.\r\n\r\nCheers &amp; nice to see positive
    stuff from someone who actually owns one (then again it's probably because you
    actually own one)\r\n\r\nMcD"

    real HD content I see is from video podcasts. But it's coming for sure.\r\n\r\nHard
    part is ripping the entire library. (Ugh) But still well worth it in the end.
    Just got done watching Little Miss Sunshine on it, now I'm watching BSG Season
    2. Pure heaven."

<p><img src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/images/appletv.jpg" border="2" height="100" width="154" class="left">So I spent the weekend with my new Apple TV. (Thank you baby for the purchase) I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have too many words to describe how impressed I am with this device so far. So if you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re looking for someone who is displeased with the product, you can stop reading now.</p>
<p>The setup of it was a snap. Took it out of the box, plugged it in and with a few button clicks it had located my wireless network, iTunes Library and all necessary content. The only part of the setup was even mildly difficult was the iTunes keypass. The apple TV will generates a pairing between your iTunes Library and the apple TV. Apple TV gives a sequence of 4 numbers that have to be entered in your iTunes application. Again, easy as pie.</p>
<p>The number one complaint I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve been hearing is the hard drive space, a measly 40 gigs. In reality its actually only 32 gigs by the time you get to put data on it. But that really doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t matter. Why? Because the product streams video from your iTunes library wirelessly and it does it VERY well. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m on a G wireless network and I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve noticed no slow down and only about 5 seconds worth of wait time for video playback. I can deal with 5 seconds. So for something that handles video so well I say who needs bigger hard drives.</p>
<p>There is one downside to streaming now that I think about it. To stream video it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a separate menu off of the main interface. So you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve got to go one level down from the menu to see your full library. OOOOOH. Not a big deal. (And of course your computer has to be on)</p>
<p>Syncing to the apple TV can be weird due to its definition of a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;viewed&acirc;&euro; movie. For example by default it syncs the 5 most recent films. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve been adding movies to my library like crazy. Stephanie was watching &acirc;&euro;&oelig;National Treasure&acirc;&euro; and had to pause it before finishing. I added a few more movies and poof&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;National Treasure was off the hard drive, so she couldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t resume her playback from the current spot. (Yes, it has a resume feature. awesome) She had to stream it from the network and skip chapters. (Skipping chapters also requires that 5 second wait when streaming video)</p>
<p>I know I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m all over the place with this article, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s just so cool and so much is popping into my mind. Two products you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll absolutely need to begin creating your digital library is <a href="http://handbrake.m0k.org/">Handbrake</a> and <a href="http://www.techspansion.com/visualhub/">Visual Hub</a> for the Mac. Handbrake will rip videos from DVD and convert them into MP4 with STUNNING quality at a small file size. I managed to rip National Treasure, which was about 1hr 40 minutes long into a 1-gig file. When I asked Stephanie about the quality she said &acirc;&euro;&oelig;its great why? The quality of the video never occurred to me because it looks like a normal DVD&acirc;&euro;. That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s no small feat.  Visual Hub will convert other pesky formats into MP4 for you, so if your hypothetically downloading shows and need to hypothetically convert them, that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the tool for you. Both of these are Mac products by the way. I believe Handbrake has a windows version though.</p>
<p>So now I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m going through the process of converting my library into MP4. Not the entire library mind you, just the movies that I might actually watch. But the real bang for the buck is in the department of Video Podcast. There is something to be said about watching <a href="http://www.twit.tv/MB">Mac Break</a> or <a href="http://www.photoshoptv.com/">PhotoshopTV</a> in your living room. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m in love with this device.</p>
