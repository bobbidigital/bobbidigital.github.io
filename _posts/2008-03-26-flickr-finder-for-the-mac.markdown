<p>I have a pretty big dilemma. I LOVE Flickr to no end. I love it like fat kids love cake. But the problem is I'm not a huge fan of the web browser experience. (It's both the fault of the browsers, lack of strict standards following and the inherent limitations in web technologies at the moment)</p>
<p>But <a href="http://gragsie.com/FlickrFinder/">Flickr Finder</a> allows me to enjoy my Flickr experience without the pesky bother of a web experience. Flickr Finder works much like Mac's regular finder only for Flickr. Pretty self explanatory.&Acirc;&nbsp; It's Mac only, but check it out when you get a chance. (Or when you get a Mac)</p>

<p>Big Ups to <a href="http://blog.zemote.com/" target="_blank">Zemote</a> for blessing me with this knowledge.</p>
