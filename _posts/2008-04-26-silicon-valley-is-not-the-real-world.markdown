  her face a painting of concentration. I notice she&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not alone,

  content: "You make a good point here, but this isn't just a Silicon Valley thing.
    \ It's also a financial sector thing.  In the cases you mention, you're absolutely
    right, plenty of people still read newspapers and buys cds and dvds and have plenty
    of stuff that they don't yet do using the internet.  But I think most of the time
    when people call something like that \"dead\" they are focusing more on the fact
    that it's no longer a business that grows.  Sure it still makes money now and
    is good for that, but the number of people that use it is consistently shrinking
    and in the next few years it will get to the point where the amount of money they
    can afford to put into the business will also shrink, until they point where they
    are no longer profitable no matter how many more people they fire.  Generally
    that's a business that the stock market doesn't like and most companies don't
    want to be in, because they don't want to close up shop.  There was a story today
    about a newspaper that stopped publishing a print edition and is focusing exclusively
    online http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/28/business/media/28link.html?em&amp;ex=1209528000&amp;en=0e84dd58a11c0493&amp;ei=5087%0A\r\nso
    even though it will be a few years before that happens to a paper like the New
    York Times, it's a less distant reality than you may think, and it's the present
    for some. Traditional media has good reason to fear and try to react quickly,
    because that opportunity might be all they have soon.  They can't afford to think
    about how much time that crossover will take.  I for one hope good reporters find
    a way to make money online soon, cause it's something the country can't afford
    not to have.  I think it'll happen, people tend to find a way to make money if
    there is one. Hopefully it won't only be with flashing banner ads."

  content: Excellent points in your response! I think to me the biggest problem will
    be inventing a business model that the online community will accept. We've learned
    quickly that the online community is quite adverse to the same strategies we've
    used in traditional media. The problem is the models that online communities DO
    like, don't always leave as high a profit margin. Some companies might just have
    to accept the reality of slimmer pockets for the board of directors. Thanks for
    the comment.

<p>A young woman stands with her little daughter at her side, limply holding hands. I can tell that she&acirc;&euro;&trade;s listening intently to something, her face a painting of concentration. I notice she&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not alone, as I follow her gaze to a store employee with a small gathering around him. My curiosity now piqued I move in closer to find out what this employee is mesmerizing his audience with. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;So does it play DVD&acirc;&euro;&trade;s?&acirc;&euro; the young woman asked. She was talking of course about the Apple TV. She and the people around her just simply didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t get it. </p>
<p>The beauty of the technically inclined is that they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re capable of creating a field of illusion with regards to how the real world actually operates.&Acirc;&nbsp; This statement is illustrated in no place better than the beloved tech epicenter of Silicon Valley.<br />

<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-353"></a><br />
For a long time my mornings were filled with the ramblings of voices from Silicon Valley and it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s surrounding towns and cities. I would listen to each podcaster pontificate on the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;death&acirc;&euro; of traditional sources of media, entertainment and knowledge exchange, each one offering their own digital solution to a legacy implementation. Everything from newspapers to CD&acirc;&euro;&trade;s and DVD&acirc;&euro;&trade;s, the Internet is filled with declarations of the death of old media. I laugh at this notion mainly because with all the new waves of media that are rising, most people aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t getting paid for it. No pay ultimately limits a product&acirc;&euro;&trade;s power to sustain and stick around.<br />
&Acirc;&nbsp;<br />
In Silicon Valley I do not doubt that claims of optical media&acirc;&euro;&trade;s demise are probably true. But once you get 100 miles outside the valley, optical media is very much alive. I hang around with a lot of folks that are not early adopters of technology such as myself. They still think Apple TV is an actual television.&Acirc;&nbsp; Now a lot of people will gawk at the idea that I use Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s product as a basis of comparison, but guess what? It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the only digital media delivery system that anyone without a Computer Science degree has ever heard of. The idea of hooking a computer to their television set is insane to them. I explain the Xbox 360 Media Connect option and the response is &acirc;&euro;&oelig;You can do that?&acirc;&euro;&Acirc;&nbsp; &acirc;&euro;&oelig;So how do you watch movies?&acirc;&euro; is of course the logical question.&Acirc;&nbsp; The non-technically inclined always answer the same way.&Acirc;&nbsp; Cable or DVD&acirc;&euro;&trade;s.<br />
&Acirc;&nbsp;<br />
Now the way that people are acquiring media is different, hence the declining sales numbers. There&acirc;&euro;&trade;s no need to purchase DVD&acirc;&euro;&trade;s when you can rent them from Blockbuster or Netflix. I doubt most people watch that many DVD&acirc;&euro;&trade;s anyways, especially with the poor quality of films that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s been flooding the distribution channels. There are days where I think I need to call Roto Rooter for my cable box because there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s nothing but shit coming through it. Hollywood has long been guilty of doing nothing but feeding us the same regurgitated, rehashed, formulaic, special-fx filled garbage. Only so often do we get treated to a truly stellar film. So no wonder DVD sales are down. Not because people would rather download their movies, but because they would rather watch Survivor than a remake of a remake. (Or re-imagining as we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re starting to call it)<br />
&Acirc;&nbsp;<br />
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Nobody reads the paper anymore.&acirc;&euro; I hear that quote a lot on Tech Valley based podcasts. I guess they&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve never been on a subway. Every morning there is a sea of page flipping business folks sucking up all the information they can, eyes scanning like mad across the articles. &Acirc;&nbsp;Sure classified sales are down, but that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not because people aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t reading the paper. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s because on Craigslist I can reach a hell of a lot more people and it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s free. So the paper needs to reinvent revenue streams, but the newspaper business is far from dead.<br />
&Acirc;&nbsp;<br />
We keep hearing about bloggers replacing traditional journalist. I can only respond with &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Yeah fucking right.&acirc;&euro; What do bloggers do?&Acirc;&nbsp; (Yours truly included) We repost already reported information and offer our own take on it. But there still needs to be an original SOURCE to get the ball rolling. That source needs to be getting paid.&Acirc;&nbsp; If newspaper outlets died off, what good would all of us bloggers be to the world? It would be a life filled of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Best 10&acirc;&euro; lists.<br />
&Acirc;&nbsp;<br />
The Internet actually ends up causing more problems, not less. Sure the ease of access makes life a little more convenient, but the speed of the Internet makes for rushed delivery (albeit quick corrections) and information overload. Anyone who subscribes to Engadget knows exactly what I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m talking about. There are 50 or more articles posted daily by some of these sites.&Acirc;&nbsp; You can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t possibly keep up with all of it, yet you feel compelled to. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s news!&acirc;&euro;, is the most common justification. No it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not. Half of it is crap. The few good articles get buried by your fast paced method of figuring out what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s worth the extra mouse click and what needs to be removed from your life entirely. Most average people I know don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know what an RSS reader is, making the task even more daunting. They don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t bother going online because they don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t like to read things on the computer, or because they can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t take the article with them. The average joe is probably oblivious to the technical solutions around him, let alone find them enjoyable to use.<br />
&Acirc;&nbsp;<br />
The reality of life is not the one seen or communicated from Silicon Valley. Most people don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know what a Twitter is. Social networking is useless as a tool for big business. Most technophiles are turned off by online advertising, so what good is it having a business on our twitter feed? Do you want IBM as your MySpace friend? A few businesses &acirc;&euro;&oelig;get it&acirc;&euro;, but it takes a special kind of business for social networking to be effective. You have to be part of the community, not just a flood gate of commercials.<br />
&Acirc;&nbsp;<br />
The key to adoption is simplicity and a clear pack leader. I know that competition is the consumer&acirc;&euro;&trade;s friend, but it also is the source of the consumer&acirc;&euro;&trade;s confusion. Why is digital music taking off? Because for the most part there is one player in the market and the solution is simple. People who own Zunes or a Rhapsody compatible player are probably the early adopters. Soccer moms own iPod&acirc;&euro;&trade;s, plain and simple. So if we want all these digital Web 2.0 tools and ideas to take over mainstream media, then we need a pack leader. We need a dominant player to ease the pain of entry for newcomers. Why were so many people on the sidelines of the HD-format wars? Because it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s too complex for the average consumer, meaning poor adoption rate, meaning one format (or possibly both) will die. We see the same type of things happening on the Internet.</p>
<p>The ideas of Web 2.0 and this massive technological revolution are mind numbing. There is a vast amount of opportunity, but at the moment that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s all it is. Traditional media is in fear of the opportunity that the digital age is bringing about. But most institutions are far from the death that has been prophesied. They still have quite a few years before the generation that will require a digital mindset is old enough to buy beer.</p>
