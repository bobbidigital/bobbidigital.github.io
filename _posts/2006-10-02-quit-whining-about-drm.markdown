  content: 'The only trouble I''ve come across re: DRM, is with iTunes. We rebuild/repurpose
    computers more than most homes, but last time the computer was rebuilt I got a
    nag e-mail telling me that I had reached my limit of 5 machines (even though 3
    were the same machine just rebuilt). Let''s just say that if I''m not allowed
    to play my legally bought music the next time the machine has to be rebuilt, I''ll
    download the same songs and seriously reconsider iTunes as a music source.'

  content: There is an option in iTunes to deauthorize all machines. Then authorization
    is as simple as providing yoru username and password on the machines you want.
    Voila! Had to do it myself =)

<p><img align="left" src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/images/zuned.jpg" />Ok even I admit that Digital Rights Management can be a pain in the ass. But come on people, lets get serious. Your right it does prevent you from doing perfectly legal things with your purchased music or movies. But your telling me that companies shouldn't have a right to protect their shit?</p>
<p>You know most of the people I know who bitch about DRM are also software and music pirates. The only time I've had a problem with DRM is when I was trying to do something illegal with music. I do believe that we need some form of DRM authority organization of some sort. Cause really, the only time DRM pisses me off is when I'm trying to use things across proprietary DRM solutions. Perfect example. I can't play my iTunes purchased music on my XBox 360.&Acirc;&nbsp; Ok yeah, thats a bit of a pain in the ass. But I can do everything else I need to with the music.</p>
<p>Bottomline is I feel companies have the right to protect their property. DRM is not the enemy. Too many people are all about free shit in this world. (Yours truly included) I may pirate music occasionally, but I sure as hell don't bitch that companies are trying to get paid for their work.</p>
