<p>It's a sad sad day. Star Trek: The Experience will be closing it's doors on September 1st 2008. During my trip to Las Vegas I didn't even get a chance to go to the exhibit thanks to some really poor timing and long lines. I hope to make it out there soon as I've never been on the actual ride. (Although Quark's Bar was hot)</p>
