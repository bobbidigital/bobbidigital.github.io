<p><img src="images/iphone.jpg" height="150" width="150" border="2" class="left">There has been a lot of buzz about iPhone's apparent lack of 3rd party apps and an SDK for the platform. Many are calling for Steve Job's head, saying that this will cripple the iPhone. Lets get something straight, Stevie boy is no idiot. He knows what consumer's want and I'm sure in time  the Cupertino boys will deliver.  For those that don't know Google and Apple have already paired up to bring Google Applications onto the iPhone. </p>
<p>This makes perfect sense. Think about it, this way they're not bound to something they said months before they actually enter the market. Even though the iPhone is running OS X, it's still a new platform and a brave new world that they're entering. Why risk the stability (and name) of your initial launch of a platform by opening it up to shitty software developers?</p>
<p>So instead of opening it to shitty developers, they open it to some of the best in the business, namely Google. Why? Because Apple probably feels safe with Google, based on their previous successes on many mobile platforms. I'm sure Google won't be the last to get a crack at the platform either.</p>
<p>So the morale of the story is chillout. It's coming. Check out <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/06/wherefore_art_thou_iphone_sdk">John Gruber's post </a>on the situation. The man knows what he's talking about. </p>
