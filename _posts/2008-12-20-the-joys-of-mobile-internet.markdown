  content: You're right - mobile internet is hot. BUT, I couldn't be without some
    type of DSL, broadband, or cable speed. But ya know, that's just me - lol.

  content: I don't think it'll work long term by any means. But I'm surprised at how
    well the iPhone is holding up under regular usage you know? So far the only thing
    i've done on my laptop that I can't do on my iPhone is watch Hulu. I am however
    seriously considering getting a mobile broadband card from Verizon.

<p>The mobile Internet is a beautiful thing. My family isn't really into the Internet. Wifi isn't in abundance in Dublin Georgia eitheir. So all of my access has been through my iPhone. So far I've been able to do anything and everything with it, including this post.</p>
<p>I wake up in the morning and get my morning news via the AP News app. I'm checking in on my Twitter folks and making updates when I can. I watched The Daek Knight in bed after my mother fell asleep, complete with headphones to keep from disturbing her. </p>
<p>Last night mom mentioned her love for Tyler Perry films. Well thanks to the Amazon application I was able to look up the collectors edition, order it and have it shipped here in time for Christmas. </p>
<p>Mom is in awe at everything this gizmo can do. I think she wants one now. </p>
