<p>I love the television show LOST. In fact it's one of a few shows that I refuse to watch on DVR. I need to be on my couch taking in that great mind job the day, date and time it comes out. But I have to admit that my patience with the show is starting to wear just a *little* bit thin.</p>
<p>I've got the same problem that most people have with LOST. Where are we going? Which questions will be answered and which ones will fall victim to the "we didn't know where the fuck we were going then" phase of writing. The show has challenged us as viewers in ways that were new to the TV genre. Through the series we've watched as the object of our inquiries has been switched around through clever writing techniques. Remember when we had that mechanical sounding thing in the jungle that was going around sniffing out people and eating them or whatever? Then suddenly we're shown it's a black cloud of smoke and told that it's a "defense mechanism for the island". &Acirc;&nbsp;Some producer must have thought "Good enough, lets move on".</p>
<p>Move on to what though? Let's move on to creating more questions! Like the entire hatch story line. We got enough answers about the hatch but those answers are superficial and lead into more questions. And for me these answers would feel great if the new round of questions didn't make the previous discoveries feel insignificant. Even when the answer is delivered it's not in cliff hanger fashion. It's not at a point in the show where you feel "this is BIG". It's part of Ben's dialogue or some passing conversation and we move on. So you feel like you're actually being instructed by the writer that "this has no purpose". (I admit that sometimes this is not the case, but you'd be suprised how often it is) Every answer they give us can usually be revealed as a clever smoke screen by asking "Why" or "From What".</p>
<p>"We need to MOVE the island". "Why?" "To protect it." "From what?" "From people who want to destroy it." "Why?" "I can't tell you anymore than that, trust me." As much as I love the Ben character too he should have been killed 30 times over. How many times can you tell real people to "trust" you and then fuck them over in the way Ben does?</p>
<p>No doubt I'll be waiting for the season premiere but I better start getting some SIGNIFICANT answers real soon. The longer they delay, the bigger the payoff a viewer is going to expect. If they string me along like this and then tell me it's a dream or some bullshit like that, someone will have to go. That's the only way to handle it.</p>
<p>Good luck JJ. I hope all your other projects don't spoil this one. Don't let me down like you did with Alias.</p>
