excerpt: "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I have not been the biggest fan of the Superman All-Star
  series. It turns out that I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m probably being labeled as a communist
  lover by comic book geeks all around the world. But the funny thing is the only
  people I have heard say they DO like this series are people with a much much larger
  audience than me. But for the everyday folks that I run into and discuss this series
  with, most of them give me a resounding &acirc;&euro;&oelig;eh&acirc;&euro;\x9D.</p>\r\n<p
  class=\"MsoNormal\">Well with issue #10 here there has been a lot of buzz surrounding
  this book. So I said let me pick it up again and see what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s what.
  I agree <a href=\"httphttp://www.google.com/search?q=Superman+All-star+10+review&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=FlockInc.:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox\"
  target=\"_blank\">with the reviews</a> and won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t regurgitate
  what most of them say. A quick Google search will give you all the info you need
  in that regards.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But the reviews do make me think
  about where our love for the Man of Steel has gone.<span> </span>Until the all-star
  book Superman was starting to become a sort of irrelevant relic amongst a sea of
  vigilantes, renegades and power mongers.<span> </span>Comic book superheroes
  are now beginning to blur the lines between good and evil. Most now live in shades
  of gray.<span> </span>The gray is what makes these characters interesting in
  a way. They&acirc;&euro;&trade;re unpredictable in their nature meaning at any point
  they could make a decision that could spin the entire plotline of a story arch.
  (Think Jack Bauer) In this world of unpredictable badassness, it seems like we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve
  lost our love for the truly good guys.<span> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">"

<p class="MsoNormal"><a id="more"></a><a id="more-336"></a></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Captain America is much more popular now that he&acirc;&euro;&trade;s dead than he&acirc;&euro;&trade;s ever been before. And what did they do when they replaced Steve Rogers with the Winter Soldier to wield the Captain America shield? They gave him a gun to go with it.<span> </span>Why? They want to add a level of badassness to the otherwise goody-good guy character. (This is in no way a diss on the Captain America book. <span> </span>I like what I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve read) You have to admit, the Winter Soldier character brings a bit of a gritty edge that is quite distinguishable from the original Captain America. And there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a 1000 and 1 reasons for this I know, but you can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t deny the trend towards shades-of-gray superheroes. Captain America is just one more example of how characters can be reinvented by making them more&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;.modern. Has the original Captain America become irrelevant?</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So the bigger question to me is what exactly is pushing us in this direction? It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s clear that the America of today is much different than the America my parents were raised in. <span> </span>(Some for the better, some for the worse) I can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t help but ask if we as a people have lost some of our sense of morality? Have we become a society that let indiscretions that 30 years ago would be considered appalling? Now we pass them off as the failings of man. We&acirc;&euro;&trade;re not shocked by Governors and hookers, celebrity sex tapes, high ranking officials committing perjury. <span> </span>Sure it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s part of this news cycle that consumes us for 48 hours, but after that it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s business as usual. But it doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have to be that way.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The thing I like about fiction in general is that our characters are creations of our minds. No historical reference be adhered to, nor any sense of realism required. This makes our characters and our ideas for them boundless. Why not have a hero that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a boy scout? Why not create someone who is as morally centered as anyone can be? And instead of shunning him, why aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t we aspiring to be more like him? Comic book heroes are slowly becoming more like what we ARE, but I miss the days when they were more like what we wanted to BE. I for one would take the morale center of Superman or Captain America any day.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Being a good guy is becoming unfashionable amongst our youth.<span> </span>Straight A students are nerds. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s cool to drink and smoke pot. The good guys out there are after women who want the bad boy. Music artist who talk about murder, the drug game and gun play shoot to the top of billboard charts. All around us we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re in a morale free fall. And instead of my beloved comics being that ray of hope, they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re following the trend.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I think Superman and Captain America should be more relevant today than they ever have before.</p></p>
