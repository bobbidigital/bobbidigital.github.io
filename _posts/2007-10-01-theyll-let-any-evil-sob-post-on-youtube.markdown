<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/28/business/media/28recruit.html?_r=2&amp;th=&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;emc=th&amp;adxnnlx=1191206735-FOYgFdShEoOpH/BNOgKl2A">Lawyers use YouTube as a recruiting tool.</a> Evidently there is such competition for lawyers that law firms are posting videos including a catchy little Mac vs. PC rip called "Choate vs. Megafirm"</p>
<blockquote><p>In four spots called &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Choate vs. Megafirm,&acirc;&euro; a hapless male associate at Megafirm is seen variously trying to find his briefcase in one of his employer&acirc;&euro;&trade;s many offices; tied up in boat rope, explaining that the firm placed him in &acirc;&euro;&oelig;leveraged lease and ship financing&acirc;&euro; when he really wanted litigation; and clad in a business suit, pants rolled up, with an inner tube around his waist, on his &acirc;&euro;&oelig;working&acirc;&euro; vacation.</p>
<p>His counterpart, a young female associate at Choate, is rather smug as she explains how life there is different. Just as on YouTube, there are ratings &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; albeit fake &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; like the one from a Web poster with the handle, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Jdhound,&acirc;&euro; who writes, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;This are like so professional. Our site not.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>Greenfield Belser, a Washington marketing firm charged $75,000 for for adds and decided on the Apple parody since this was considered a limited budget. </p>
<p>Another firm, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, hired a documentary maker who's worked for PBS to film 16 videos featureing lawyers having conversations (I envision this being as interesting as watching paint dry).</p>
<p>Norm Rubenstein of Zeughauser Group says the videos are interesting because they aim at </p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;a generation that takes the Web for granted, that values Internet-based social networking.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s what makes the video &acirc;&euro;&tilde;conversations&acirc;&euro;&trade; on the Sullivan site or the mock commercials on Choate&acirc;&euro;&trade;s site so compelling,&acirc;&euro;  &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Compared to the traditional iteration of marquee clients, major deals and disputes, these express true personality in ways that are memorable.&acirc;&euro;</blockquote></p>
<p>And now, Lawyer jokes.</p>
<p>How can you tell when a lawyer is lying?<br />
   <em> Their lips move.</em><br />
What do lawyers and sperm have in common?<br />
   <em> One in 50,000,000 has a chance of becoming a human being.</em><br />
What's the difference between a dead lawyer on a street and a dead dog on the street?<br />
    <em>There are skid marks in front of the dog.</em><br />
How do you stop a lawyer from drowning?<br />
    <em>Take your foot off it's head</em><br />
If you see a lawyer on a bicycle, why don't you swerve to hit him?<br />
 <em>   It might be your bicycle.<br />
</em></p>
