  content: "Yeah, that news seems to be freaking out a lot of you YOUNGER folks. Coincidentally,
    my son #2 turned 17 today, but then he's been taller than me for a while now,
    anyway.\r\n\r\nI spent a lot  of time around elderly (you don't call them OLD)
    people when I was little, so I don't guess I worry about getting old too much.\r\n\r\nI
    just hope I don't have to have all my food strained like baby food when I get
    old ... that would be hard to deal with!"

<p>I've been meaning to write this for awhile. Spencer Elden turned 17 this month. I feel so old. Your probably wondering who the hell Spencer Elden is. You'll recognize him when you see him. </p>
