Now I'm seriously starting to believe John C. Dvorak's comments. The cranky geek has long proclaimed that the format war was instigated by Microsoft in order to bolster sales and the adoption of digital downloads. HD-DVD's body isn't even cold yet and the media is already attempting to start another format war.</p>
<p>The bottom line is until broadband speeds are incredibly faster, digital downloads will remain a niche market, reserved predominantly for tech geeks and some college students. Soccer moms are a long way from getting their entertainment from the ether. Now the question is, does anyone really care about Blu-ray or HD quality movies in general? Anyone beyond the aforementioned groups of course.  Not to beat a dead horse, but I'm sure soccer moms are not sitting on the sidelines talking about Jimmy's math teacher and the differences between 720p and 1080i.</p>
