Wow, I can't believe that [C2E2](http://www.c2e2.com) is almost here! The con has definitely become one of my favorite events of the year and I'm glad that [CNSC](http://www.chicagonerds.com) got the opportunity to work with them again.

This year I'm also excited to be moderating a panel entitled "Opening the Clubhouse Doors: Creating More Inclusive Geek Communities".  If you're going to be at C2E2, for selfish reasons, I highly recommend you check it out.

**Date**: Friday April 25

**Time**: 6:30pm - 7:30pm

**Location**: S401CD

On the panel will be 

* [Michi Trota](http://www.twitter.com/geekmelange), blogger, essayist, fire spinner and general bad ass.
* [Mary Robinette Kowal](http://www.maryrobinettekowal.com) , Hugo Award-Winning Sci-Fi and Fantasy author.
* [Mary Anne Mohanraj](http://www.mamohanraj.com/index.php) founded the World Fantasy Award-winning and Hugo-nominated magazine, Strange Horizons.
* [Karlyn Meyer](http://www.twitter.com/karlyn_darlin) is an attorney who uses her vacation days to work at PAX and game development conferences. She studied intellectual property and the lawâ€™s application to gender and sexuality
* [Scott Snyder](http://www.twitter.com/Ssnyder1835) is a comic book writer working for the likes of DC and Marvel as well as creator owned titles. You can see Scott's do his thing on the pages of Batman and The Wake.

As you can tell, this is going to be an awesome panel. Some of our panelists were together last year at C2E2 for the Excorcising the Spectre of the Fake Geek Girl panel. Video link below.
