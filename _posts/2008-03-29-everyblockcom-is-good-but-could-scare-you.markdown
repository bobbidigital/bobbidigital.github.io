excerpt: '<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; margin:
  0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px">In the current days of information overload,
  sometimes it seems blasphemous to say what I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m about to say.
  You know me, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m going to say it anyways. Sometimes you can get
  too much information. Everyblock.com is such a place where you indulge yourself
  with an unhealthy amount of data. You try to stop, but you can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t
  help yourself. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s like watching a car crash, you can only sit
  back and take it in and once you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve opened Pandora&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
  box, there is no closing it.</span></p><p style="font: normal normal normal

  margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px">Everyblock.com is a public records
  and information aggregator based on your location. I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know
  how wide the launch is intended to be, but currently it only serves the Chicago,
  New York City and San Francisco areas. All things considered that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
  quite a feat in itself. There is a massive amount of information out there on these
  locations and everyblock.com does a much better job at organizing it than the public
  records office.</span></p><p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal

<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px">How Does It Work?</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; min-height: 14px; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"></span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px">Simple. Choose your city, enter your address or zip code and get bombarded with scary information about the places you eat, the things that happen in your neighborhood and when Johnny Depp might be coming for a film shoot.</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; min-height: 14px; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"></span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px">The site will display recent criminal activity in your area, new business licenses being filed and restaurant inspection reports. Be warned about going to deep into any of these as you can quickly become alarmed at the types of things that go on in your area. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve had to eliminate a few of my favorite eateries due to repeated pest control violations. You can also go crazy when you realize people are being assaulted and kidnapped within a few city blocks of your house. Sometimes information freedom isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t a good thing. (Or maybe I need to move)</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; min-height: 14px; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"></span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px">But there are plenty of positive things to find out about where you live. Everyblock.com has a section for &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Missed Connections&acirc;&euro;¬ù, when you see that special someone on the train and just don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have the guts to talk to her. There&acirc;&euro;&trade;s also news articles about your area, business reviews, photos, lost and found, films shooting in the area, you get the idea.&Acirc;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; min-height: 14px; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"></span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px">The idea is a great and it also begins to illustrate an emerging trend in the Internet going from macro information to micro, local and more personal ways of using the web. &Acirc;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; min-height: 14px; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"></span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px">The site really is an excellent tool to get a pulse on the things going on around you. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m sure as the site matures it will also extend the types of data aggregated about your neck of the woods. If you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re lucky enough to live in one of the 3 cities currently available I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d suggest a trip over there ASAP.&Acirc;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; min-height: 14px; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"></span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px">Just don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t look up your favorite restaurants health inspection results. If it did well, then nothing changes, but if it did bad you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll die a little bit on the inside.</span></p>
