<p>For those of you who might be looking to pick up some non-WotC books for D20 you may want to check out Pazio, who is selling a BUTT LOAD of Green Ronin books on the cheap. WHen I say cheap, I mean CHEAP. Like $2.00 a book. So if you're curious about doing some exploring of other publishers, now will be the time to take the risk. At least the price will only be $2.00 instead of $20. I know I'll be picking some up.</p>
