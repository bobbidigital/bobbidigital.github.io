<p>Those of us who watch Professional Wrestling are familiar with the interview spots that have been a staple of the industry.&Acirc;&nbsp; Interviews give a wrestler an opportunity to sell his gimmick, get in touch with the fans and show off some of his "mic skills".</p>
<p>But<a href="http://www.joesportsfan.com" target="_blank"> JoeSportsFan.com</a> takes us back to the 80's and shows us just how over the top the interviews of that era had become.&Acirc;&nbsp; A good chuckle for sure.</p>

<blockquote><p>As regular readers of JSF know, we tend to view the 1980&acirc;&euro;&trade;s version of the WWF as one of the most dependable sources of sports-related humor in the world. It was so impactful on this generation that, to this day, we still catch Imig carrying a 2x4 and pretending to be Hacksaw Jim Duggan around the JSF offices from time to time.</p>
<p>No organization has ever matched the WWF&acirc;&euro;&trade;s deft touch at identifying every basic stereotype present in our culture and milking them for everything they were worth.</blockquote></p>
