<p>Um, BIG WTF!?!? I am not a knee jerk liberal or conservative or anything politically inclined but when I read that Jamie Foxx is being considered to portray Frank Sinatra to be directed by Martin Scorsese I almost had to look at my calender to make sure it wasn't April 1st. I mean really, Jamie Foxx? According to the IMDB blurb, it states, "...Leonardo DiCaprio and Harry Connick Jr. were among the names rumoured to be in contention for the role after it was announced earlier this month that filmmaker Martin Scorsese will direct a biopic. But now African-American actor Foxx, who won an Oscar for his portrayal of Ray Charles in 2004's Ray, has emerged as the favourite to play Ol' Blue Eyes."</p>
<p>Really? Jamie is a bonafide star who chooses some dicey roles and records music that I don't necessary dig but does he have what it takes to tackle a role that recalls Orson Wells or Sir Laurence Olivier as Othello in blackface?</p>
<p>Digging back into the archaic movie reference which is my mind, Canada Lee, an African-American musician, boxer, jockey, actor and pre-Civil Rights pioneer who actually worked with Orson Welles several times, played an European man in white face for a play with John Huston back in the 40s. He faced many polarizing reviews from critics who felt he approached the character in an over-exaggerated fashion while others felt he tackled the role as beautifully as his past roles. What he conveyed was not a caricature of a person but the character of a misunderstood man. Whether the character was white or black is inconsequential.</p>
<p>As I write this a part of me is screaming, "But isn't this what many people struggled for? To be accepted as an artist first and foremost without consideration for race or culture?" You can imagine the dilemma I face; a black man is considered to play an Italian crooner and I am raising a fuss? I am raising a fuss because this is different yet the same; Christopher Lee as Fu Manchu, Al Jolson in blackface, Li Gong as a Geisha. The list goes on and I don't have the time (my boss is yelling my name as I write this).</p>
<p>All I am getting at is get the right actor for the job. Don't take an icon to many people the world over and polarize them because of a choice that could possibly spell the end for Scorsese and even Foxx. Or it could be the most daring, profound piece of film ever made. Only time will tell. And an Oscar may be in waiting in the rafters. I just don't know how Jamie is going to look in blue contacts. Maybe they'll get Adrien Brody to play Sammy Davis, Jr.</p>
