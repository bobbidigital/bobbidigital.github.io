<p><a href="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/uawrap.jpg"><img src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/uawrap-300x220.jpg" alt="Umbrella Academy Funeral" title="Umbrella Academy Funeral" width="300" height="220" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-564" /></a> Good effin' morning!!! I finally made a trip to the comic book store this weekend (thanks Earthworld!) and picked up the past four issues of The Umbrella Academy: Dallas (six issue limited) and the next volume of The Luna Brothers' The Sword. Since I can't let good lit sit around too long without a bent page or two, I absorbed them with vigor, and as usual, was left wanting more! Hopefully the next volume of The Killer by Jacamon and Matz will be out soon. Amazon states it was released Oct. 2008 but Deepdiscount.com states Feb 28, 2009. What to believe?</p>
<p>First off, when I picked up the first Umbrella Academy series, Apocalypse Suite, I collected the floppies rather than wait for the trade (something I have been doing with DMZ, Queen and Country, The Exterminators, and 100 Bullets) because I was intrigued by the art as well as the storyline. The story follows a group of seven superheroes adopted by a Col. Hargreeves, an automaton mother, and a talking chimp who is a close friend to one of the time traveling characters named Number Five who also happens to be stuck in the body of a ten year old. Don't ask, just read. Written by Gerard Way, lead singer of My Chemical Romance, and wonderfully drawn by Gabriel Ba (who also happens to be the artist of another kick ass series named Casanova) the reader is drawn into an alternative universe where the Eiffel Tower is actually a ship and talking chimps are commonplace. The first story arc is reminiscent of a pop song; first the intro, the verse, the chorus and then the bridge to a final denouement. Yes the last part is usually relegated to film but in this case, a cinematic term does fit quite nicely. Far from the feel-good Power Pack or Fantastic Four, this series follows the members of the disbanded group The Umbrella Academy after the death of their father, Col. Hargreeves. They decide to save the world again in honor of their father even though there is more than meets the eye when it comes to their father's past. Without ruining the surprise, consider it par for the course with this surprisingly refreshing take on the family dynamic in a superhero realm. Get the trade of the Apocalypse Suite and then go out and get the latest Umbrella Academy: Dallas floppies.</p>

<p>The Sword is another great addition to the fantasy genre by the Luna Brothers. Dara Brighton, a wheelchair bound art student, and her family are attacked by three siblings looking for a sword they believe her father has. After killing her family and realizing they may have made a mistake, they decide to finish off Dara by setting fire to the home and hopefully killing her in the process making it seem like an accident. The house collapses, Dara falls into the basement and finds a sword in the dirt floor. Once she grabs it, her wounds heal and she can walk again. Much ass-kickery is in the future for our young heroine. This series is expected to run for two years according to the Lunas and so far, so good. I haven't been collecting the floppies as I am limiting myself but the most recent trade (Volume 2: Water, Volume 1 is Fire) definitely has me salivating for the next trade. Currently up to issue 15, there are only 9 issues left and I am being patient. As patient as I can.</p>
<p>On another note, I am seriously considering getting Locke and Key from IDW. It has a basic premise but good ole Blair on Fresh Ink had a lot of good things to say about it for the 2008 year, so I may have to check it out. I don't like ALL of her reviews but she is definitely on top of her shit. Since I have no desire to talk about Y The Last Man anymore with Caruso and LaBeouf involved, I'm going to go over Casanova by Gabriel Ba and Matt Fraction next time. Keep on reading on! And on another note, just found this out: The Umbrella Academy is being adapted for the big screen for a possible 2012 release. Surprised? Mark my words, the HWood studios are going to want to adapt Astro City, Cerebus, Bone, and The Walking Dead next. *sigh* And there probably won't be any Watchmen prequel/sequel considering the huge dropoff from last week's opening. Only 86 million in two weeks. I'm still reserving judgment for the end of year deluxe sit-on-my-arse-for-almost-five-hours edition. </p>
