<p>I've played and have managed a fair number of RPG games from a myriad of systems. One of the most consistent problems that I run into however is drawing the line between what a character is capable of and what a player is capable of. This may sound like roleplaying elitism but it can cause problems within the game.</p>
<p>Technically you have two ends of the spectrum. You've got the player who's too smart for his character or the more common scenario when a player is not as knowledgeable as his character should be. Most people I know that are roleplayers have a tendency to be introverted. They break this shell to play the game, but sometimes roleplaying can be a taxing ordeal for them. How does this babbling idiot seek an audience with a king and not insult him? The character has a Diplomacy skill check of +15. I hardly doubt he'll begin the exchange with a gesture that's insulting in this particular land.</p>
<p>The entire point of the game is to wrap yourself in this world of fantasy and to hold the role of something you're probably not in the real world.&Acirc;&nbsp; At the same time we want to make sure that the player isn't using his character to do all the work. "I say something I think he'll like" isn't really in the spirit of the game either.</p>
<p>The best way I've found to handle this is to come up with a simple system that defines any action involving a skill that the character posses but the player does not. (Or isn't as proficient in it as his character)</p>
<p>1.&Acirc;&nbsp; Declare the result the player wants. (I want to talk to the king into letting us free)</p>
<p>2. Declare the skill that the player will use. (Diplomacy)</p>
<p>3.&Acirc;&nbsp; Declare how the character will approach the matter. (Appeal to the King's sense of honor, or threaten the King with a brutal retaliation from your country)</p>
<p>Now that sounds pretty basic,&Acirc;&nbsp; but the key as a DM is to make sure you accept the possibility that ANY approach could be successful. Threatening a king is a difficult proposition, that is of course assuming the king isn't afraid of you. But the CHARACTER could give such a convincing performance that the king might have to think twice. What if there is an army waiting to unleash it's wrath on the city? If the scenario is extremely unlikely, sure throw a modifier in there, but never assume it's completely impossible.</p>
<p>This example deals specifically with diplomacy, but there are other skills that can be used the same way. In some game systems there is the Survival skill. You're in the desert with no food and no water.&Acirc;&nbsp; If the player wants to find a way to survive, it's unfair to ask the PLAYER "what are you looking for?"&Acirc;&nbsp; But allowing the player to state "My character is attempting to find any type of sustenance. I'm going to check for any type of animal or vegetation that might allow me to eat or drink using my survival skill".&Acirc;&nbsp; So the player doesn't need to know how to get water from a cactus plant, but the character will know how to do it for sure.</p>
<p>So just remember when you're running your game, that characters and players are two totally different things. That being said make sure you don't let a guy with a minus to his skill check best the guy with a +15 because he had a bad roll. Natural 20's should only allow a player to go so far.&Acirc;&nbsp; Sure I know a little bit about cars, but I'll never by dumb chance fix someones transmission.</p>
