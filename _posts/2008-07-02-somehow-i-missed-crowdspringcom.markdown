<p>Not sure how this one fell through the cracks. For someone as utterly shitty at design work as I am, <a href="http://www.crowdspring.com/">crowdspring.com</a> makes life easy.</p>
<p>How does it work? Simple. Come up with a project you'd like to have done, whether it be a website design, a logo design, page layout etc.&Acirc;&nbsp; During the project creation you specify how much you're willing to pay for said project. Then watch designers submit ACTUAL works to the site for your review. We're not talking about proposals or bids, I mean actual designs that you can look at and say "That's it!"</p>
<p>I'm always looking for someone to do design work and I'm always willing to pay. This site might be my new favorite friend.</p>
<p>Check it out <a href="http://www.crowdspring.com" target="_blank">www.crowdspring.com</a></p>
