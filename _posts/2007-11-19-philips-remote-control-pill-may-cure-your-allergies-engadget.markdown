<p>Again pushing the lines between Science coolness and just plain ole creepiness.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.engadget.com/2007/11/19/philips-remote-control-pill-may-cure-your-allergies/"><p>Philips has applied for a patent of a remote controlled pill which can be signaled to dose your innards via an external, electronic trigger. Freaky, we know. These aren't just time-controlled coatings now, but automated medicament delivery systems whose course can be monitored inside the body via MRI or ultrasound before precision ejection. Better yet perhaps for allergy sufferers, the device could be designed to communicate with external sensors which would release drugs if say the atmospheric pollen count reached a certain level. Tip for the colon: never confuse the remote-controlled pill with Philips' remote control tablet. You can thanks us later. </blockquote><cite cite="http://www.engadget.com/2007/11/19/philips-remote-control-pill-may-cure-your-allergies/"><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/11/19/philips-remote-control-pill-may-cure-your-allergies/">Philips' remote control pill may cure your allergies - Engadget</a></cite></p>
