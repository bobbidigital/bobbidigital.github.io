<p><a href="http://www.toptal.com/python/why-are-there-so-many-pythons">Found a great blog post</a> on the many implementations of Python today. If you only take one thing away from the article, this would be it.</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The first thing to realize is that &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Python&acirc;&euro;&trade; is an interface. There&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a specification of what Python should do and how it should behave (as with any interface). And there are multiple implementations (as with any interface)."</p><br />
