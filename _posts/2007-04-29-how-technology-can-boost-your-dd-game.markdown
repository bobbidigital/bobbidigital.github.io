<p><img src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/images/dnd.jpg" class="left" border="1" height="204" width="272" />So I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m sitting in our Dungeons and Dragons game last night and a series of realizations came to me. The first of which was an old notebook we had been using to keep track of all of our adventure notes. Basically our DM would recap the previous session to keep everyone minds fresh.</p>
<p>Now I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know about you, but I can type a hell of a lot faster than I can write. I also don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t mind typing, whereas I abhor writing by hand. So why not type it? But then you can even take it to the next level, type it and Blog it! That way everyone has access to it, you can search it for specific terms, categorize it based on storyline (using tags). The possibilities are endless!</p>
<p>Now as the night progresses there are several events that occur that require a bit of secrecy. Intrigue amongst the group even. So what do we do? We pass little bits of paper back and forth, sometimes quietly rolling dice and passing results back and forth. But alas wouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t IM be even sweeter? A small simple stupid chat server and client with a random number generator. I remember these existed way back in the days of BBS&acirc;&euro;&trade;s so I can only imagine that there are plenty of clients out there that do it now. (Or can with minimal modifications)</p>
<p>Battle maps are part of any good D&amp;D game. I almost am nervous to tweak with that particular aspect of the game. But there are ample tools out there that will assist you with this. A while ago I found one specific tool that would allow you to create a battle map and have each player (and the DM) control their avatar. Of course I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t remember the link, the name of the software nor can I find it on Google. But know it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s out there. I will continue to search the web for it and with any luck you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll hear something else from me about it.</p>
<p>I know that D&amp;D has a certain social aspect. Many DM&acirc;&euro;&trade;s would be afraid of losing that with some of the enhancements that I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve talked about. But I get literally gitty with the extra level of tension and secrecy that can be incurred by removing the notion of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;In game&acirc;&euro; and &acirc;&euro;&oelig;out of game&acirc;&euro; knowledge. Either way, D&amp;D is still the best fun you can have with four men locked in a room ordering takeout.</p>
