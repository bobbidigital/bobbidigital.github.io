<p>Word on the streets is that all of the workers for StarTrek.com have been laid off. Not really sure what the future holds for the site. Perhaps a consolidation of efforts? Either way it's a sad sad day.</p>

<p>And why isn't this on the FRONT page?</p>
<p>And why would they do this a year before the release of a new movie? Some things I'll never understand.</p>
