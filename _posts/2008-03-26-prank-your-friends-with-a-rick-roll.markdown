But at the same time funny as hell to see your friend's faces when they get this phone call. Enter in a telephone number and the website will call the number and blare the song "Never gonna give you up!" in the recipients ear.</p>
<p>Beware, they're probably collecting cell phone numbers for a massive SPAM campaign on cell phones.  They say they're legit though......</p>
