<p>So I've been waiting for a few days after Wizard World before I posted anything regarding my opinion of it.  It's my first comic book convention, but like other dork conventions I understand that you have to give it a few days before the nerdgasm wears off. Now that my brain is free I can be honest about my experience.</p>
<p>IT WAS AWESOME! Seriously, it's the best time I've had at any convention in quite some time. Something about the convention atmosphere just makes it so enjoyable. To be surrounded by people that are passionate about something that you love and enjoy. The costumes were great, the people were great, the deals (or at least for me) were equally great. I spent ENTIRELY too much money on graphic novels, but I mean for $5 dollars a book, how can you honestly go wrong? My spoils include some statues, some graphic novels, some original artwork as well as a few very nice paintings. (Unfortunately I have to frame them) </p>
<p>All of the guests were very down to earth and easily accessible. They were all open to conversation at the signings or at the end of a panel to further the discussions of our shared love. To think that these guys get to do this for a living. Lucky bastards I tell you. The one thing that I missed at the convention however was more panels on the actual creative process. Panels telling me about upcoming books you announced a year ago probably isn't the best way to get me excited. But if there were more panels on the creative process, work flow, things like that for aspiring content creators to be able to sink their teeth into.</p>
<p>It was also nice to meet hard working artist trying to make it in their chosen field. I saw some really talented people and their works, I even purchased a few. (Awesome Hellboy piece that I framed) They were all very relaxed, no pressure kind of people allowing you to browse, ask questions or even sign your newly purchased piece. </p>
<p>In a nutshell, I enjoyed Wizard World a lot. I'm looking forward to next year's con and hopefully so really good panels. Sad to say I can't afford San Diego's Comic Con, so I'll have to pass on that. One day perhaps. In the meantime I've got some pictures and a video for you guys to check out.</p>
