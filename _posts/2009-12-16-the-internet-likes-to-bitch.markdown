  content: "I'll admit, the iPhone has some superior features compared to my Motorola
    Smartphone.\r\n\r\nI was going to list all the great stuff the wife and I get
    through the Sprint network (great reception with only one technical issue, updating
    the network around my place of work) and Working Assets/CREDO as the customer
    service provider.  While doing so, though, other than getting long distance service
    on our landline, I realized that probably the only real reason the wife and I
    pay less per month is that we've given ourselves 300 texts each a month (pay additional
    for more than that, but it's hardly worth having more than 300 per month for each
    of us).\r\n\r\nI don't see myself changing for the iPhone.  Yeah, it looks like
    a great a little device, but I like the idea of Working Assets and some of my
    money going to non-profits that I support without having to think about it.\r\n\r\nHopefully,
    Apple will expand their contract beyond AT&amp;T for a servicing network.  I would
    think once their agreement comes to an end soon, it would be advantageous to Apple
    to expand iPhone capabilities to other networks.  I'm guessing it will probably
    become evermore important to do so with the 4G networks getting rolled out and
    hopefully becoming more prevalent soon."

<p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve spent the past few days catching up on my podcasts that I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve woefully neglected as of late. One of the recurring themes on my tech brand of shows has been a time honored tradition of bashing AT&amp;T and their bad network, poor call quality and general customer dissatisfaction. As an iPhone user I can sympathize with the cries of outrage. AT&amp;T has violated their agreement to me, the customer, yet still expects that I pay my bill on time. As I log in to their website to fulfill my half of the contract, I listen to Internet celebrities like Leo Laporte poke fun at AT&amp;T and think to myself; Maybe this time we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve gone too far.</p>
<p>My cellular plan is just over $100 dollars per month for 450 minutes and 1500 text messages. Compared to other carriers, this is not a substantial amount of talk time, but it serves my needs. Despite this steep price point, I pay it because of what the iPhone allows me to do. (Cellular coverage willing) It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s no secret that AT&amp;T has issues. Whether you subscribe to the belief that the iPhone has outpaced all reasonable expectations in terms of adoption or not, one simple fact remains. We pay our bills in exchange for a service. AT&amp;T is falling far short of delivering that service consistently, but believe it or not they are in fact trying to remedy the situation. Like any business, the key to customer satisfaction is a simple but effective strategy. Ask the customer what the problem is.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T has rolled out a new iPhone application that allows you to report coverage problems to them and describe the nature of the problem. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a smart idea, because it allows you to do it quickly and easily at the point that your experiencing the problem. The application uses your GPS location (so I imagine 1st gen users are out of luck) to identify your whereabouts and then submits that information to the cloud once cell service has been re-established. This gives AT&amp;T real, hard data in which they can go about solving the problem of coverage and capacity.</p>
<p>So why is it that show after show, I hear people poking fun at AT&amp;T for rolling this product out? Is there something funny that I missed? Maybe AT&amp;T is supposed to use their crystal ball to gaze through the abyss and into our mind&acirc;&euro;&trade;s eye to know when and where we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re having a problem. Or maybe we expect them to hire staff to search through Twitter feeds for &acirc;&euro;&oelig;at&amp;t sucks&acirc;&euro; which produces a sizable number of responses, but zero bits of usable data.</p>
<p>I hate AT&amp;T as much as the next guy, but I see this application as a good start to addressing some of their issues. Maybe it should have never gotten to this point at all. Maybe I shouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have overdraft&Acirc;&nbsp;my account purchasing a $2.00 Pepsi. Shit happens. The only thing we can do is address the issue going forward. Yes, Twitter is right, AT&amp;T sucks. But they don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have to languish in the underbelly of customer satisfaction surveys forever. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not defending AT&amp;T as a company. They&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve pissed me off quite a bit over the years. I just don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t think we should immediately strike down an idea because it came from a company we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve historically hated. (Partisan politics could take a note too, but I digress)</p>
<p>AT&amp;T is trying to climb out of this mess and is asking us for our help. If all we can do is make jokes about it, maybe the problem isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t that big after all. If you want to do something about it, download &acirc;&euro;&oelig;AT&amp;T Mark This Spot&acirc;&euro; (Yes it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a shitty name)</p>
<p>p.s. No hate for Leo Laporte, he&acirc;&euro;&trade;s just the last guy I heard laughing about it on Mac Break Weekly. It prompted me to immediately pause the show and write this post.</p>
