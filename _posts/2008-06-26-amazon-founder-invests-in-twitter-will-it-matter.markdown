<p>Another successful round of <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/amazons_bezos_invests_in_twitt.php">venture capital funding gives Twitter </a>a cool $15 million dollars to work with. The logical choice to put the money is in infrastructure and reliability. A lot of people are really excited by the fact that Jeff Bezo is involved in this round of funding. Bezo is the founder of a popular site that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s catching some buzz called &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Amazon.com&acirc;&euro;¬ù. (I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve never heard of them)</p>
<p>So with Jeff&acirc;&euro;&trade;s involvement, hopefully he&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll be able to steer the Twitter folks into making some infrastructure changes that will yield the biggest bang for the buck. Hopefully that infrastructure won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t just be servers and database tweaks, but also some redesigning of the application framework itself.</p>
<p>The problem with the Internet is that you can present a web tool with a particular idea in mind and the masses may use it for something completely different. I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know for certain, but I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m pretty sure that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s what happened to our folks at Twitter. Twitter was intended to be a micro-blogging site, but has quite recently turned into an almost Instant Messaging kind of platform. When you take into account the number of posts by people and the actual number of people involved the blogging architecture, which seemed adequate quickly becomes useless under the new load.</p>
<p>Now I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not saying that no one uses the tool for its original purpose. There are however, plenty of people that are using it for a group text message system or for a sort of informal public chat room. With this new usage pattern emerging it would seem to me that Twitter needs to rethink the actual messaging architecture to keep up with the new usage patterns. $15 million (I hope) should be able to buy some programmers to help in that regard. If I recall, DIGG had to pretty much rewrite a lot of the code from the ground up to take into account volume, usage patterns and just learning new techniques. Here&acirc;&euro;&trade;s hoping that Twitter can do the same thing and not loose too many people on the ride.</p>
<p>Good luck guys, quite a task ahead of you.</p>
