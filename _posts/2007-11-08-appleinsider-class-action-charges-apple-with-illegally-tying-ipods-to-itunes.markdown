<p>Apple is charged with a Class-action lawsuit on tying iPods to iTunes. When I read the man's argument I became fully aware of how brainwashed I've actually become. I mean I keep my iPod because to me it's the best player on the market, but how much of that opinion comes from the use of iTunes? Maybe the Zune <span style="font-weight: bold;">IS</span> a better player? Maybe if I had access to my songs on ....wait.... the Zune doesn't support Macs.</p>
<p>Forget it. Here's the article anyways.</p>
