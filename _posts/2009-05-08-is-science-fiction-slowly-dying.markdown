  content: "I was ready to come in here and slam you for nitpicking, but now I see
    what you were trying to say.  I like the idea of science fiction requiring a \"what
    if\" question.  \r\n\r\nSo as you said, the question of the hour - what do we
    call everything else?  More importantly, how do we let Hollywood know that we
    want more old school?"

  content: "Isn't that why the term \"speculative fiction\" is starting to be used?
    As a genre, the setting doesn't have to take place in space just as in the fantasy
    genre, you don't have to have dragons and evil wizards. \r\n\r\nAnd I love your
    gospel/Kirk Franklin analogy."

  content: I think it is partially evolution of a genre and partially changes in the
    expectations from viewers. For every Bladerunner and Abyss we get a few Last Starfighters
    and some "Welcome to Erf." Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Last Starfighter and ID4,
    but they are not what I would term "good" science fiction. Even our beloved Star
    Wars isn't good sci fi. It's a space opera fantasy - Wagner with a hyperdrive.
    Part of the appeal of sci fi for nerds is that it doesn't have appeal to the masses
    - we are fine reading Heinlein but when his political masterpiece is turned into
    a film we end up with a shallow WWII-in-space clich&Atilde;&copy; that happens
    to have coed shower scenes. The draw of sci fi, real, good sci fi, is its exclusive
    nature - nerds read/watch it and nerds are the new intelligentsia. It is really
    no surprise to me that the mass market media is rarely good sci fi. After all,
    the mass market thinks ID4 and The Last Starfighter are good sci fi.

    @Nikki I haven't seen the term used much, but I'll definitely keep an eye out for it. I think there are plenty of different elements to a fantasy story and plenty of films that I think are traditionally classified as "science fiction" are really in my opinion fantasy. Star Wars comes to mind.

    @Phil Yeah evolution definitely has something to do with it. I did love me some Last StarFighter, but it's another film that falls under the category of Fantasy to me. I need some good nerd reading now that the weather is nice. I hate reading in the winter. (I do most of my reading on my work commute)

    @Nic Thanks for not punching me in the face. As far as letting hollywood know, it'll be hard. The masses want this new genre that we haven't named yet. And as much as money talks, boycotting the films won't work because a) Hollywood will just say "They don't want sci-fi anymore" and b) I kinda like the special effects spectaculars. Maybe we need a huge fanmail movement?

  content: "And I thought you were going to complain that there's not enough Arthur
    C. Clark and other hard science fiction out there. . .as I was thinking about
    the novel that I'm writing and how it strikes me as fantasy-esque in its \"use\"
    of technology. . .except that the technology of my novel (thought up something
    like 5 years ago) is slowly becoming today's real technology.\r\n\r\nSure, I've
    got so many questions in my novel that I have a hard time pinpointing one. It's
    kind of weird, though, that my science fiction novel will probably no longer be
    science fiction by the time I get around to publishing it."

<p>Space Drama,&Acirc;&nbsp; Future Set Action/Thriller,&Acirc;&nbsp; Space Horror.&Acirc;&nbsp; Any of these names would more accurately describe a litany of movies that have come out recently and have been categorized as Science-Fiction, up to and including J.J. Abrahms re-launch of the Star Trek franchise.</p>
<p>However somewhere along the line, we as an audience have lost sight of what real science-fiction is all about. Today's definition really just means the film has a lot of special effects and is probably set in space or sometime in the future. Other than that it's really just an action adventure film, with no real questions raised, no social commentary given. But this is the realm where science fiction reigned. The beauty of the genre was that it could challenge social norms and values, but wrap it in an off-world approach.</p>
<p>Racism was rampant in the 60's when Star Trek first took to the airways. It made sense, in a neanderthal kind of way that people had differences and prejudices based on history, and a lot of it simply on ignorance of one another. Take the episode "<a href="http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/series/TOS/episode/68800.html" target="_blank"><em>Let That Be Your Last Battlefield</em></a>", the Enterprise comes across a political refugee named Lokai, who is seeking asylum on the Enterprise. The alien is black on one side of his body and white on the other half. (Black, not African American) Later, Kirk and crew come across another member of the species, but his colors are reversed, black on the opposite half from Lokai. This difference is the center point of years of hatred and bigotry.&Acirc;&nbsp; Placed into the context of an hour long television show, this stand-point seems ludicrous, even to those deep routed bigots out there.</p>
<p>That's the power of science fiction! It allows us to look at an issue from a different vantage point. It attempts to answer the question "what would happen if...". What would happen if we could look into the future to fight crime? What would happen if we could achieve genetic perfection? What happens when we develop artificial intelligence? Is everlasting life a goal really worth pursuing? These are all questions that science fiction attempts to answer through a narrative. I feel like the best science fiction films has a question at the heart of it. I think that question though is slowly being replaced by bright lights and special effects.</p>
<p>While I'm one for a good popcorn film (I mean I DID go see Wolverine), I think these films almost merit a separate category. I'm just not sure what to call them. I feel as if science fiction has largely gone from being a genre, to just becoming a setting. If the film is in space, it's science fiction. If it's in the future, it's science fiction. But in reality these are mostly action films in a typical science fiction setting.&Acirc;&nbsp; Again I'm not knocking these films, as they're wildly entertaining. But they are different.</p>
<p>I was having an IM conversation when I compared old science fiction and new science fiction, to gospel music and Kirk Franklin music. They share similar characteristics, but they're not the same. Maybe it's an evolution of the genre, but I there are more than a few die-hards out there that enjoy the challenge of answering one of the many questions out there about the world, the universe, and our place in it as a people and a society.</p>
<p>What would we call such genres? How can we separate so that we know when we're referring to old school vs. new school? It'll be interesting to see how the trend continues.</p>
