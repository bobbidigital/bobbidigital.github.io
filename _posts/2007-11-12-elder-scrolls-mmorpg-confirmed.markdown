<p>There's been a lot of buzz over the last few years surrounding what an Elder Scrolls MMORPG would be like. Well soon we'll wonder no longer. Bethesda has confirmed that an Elder Scrolls MMORPG is in fact in the works and ais already being touted around the blogosphere as a possible World of Warcraft killer. Not sure I'm ready to commit to that just yet, but I must say this could be a pretty hot game.</p>
