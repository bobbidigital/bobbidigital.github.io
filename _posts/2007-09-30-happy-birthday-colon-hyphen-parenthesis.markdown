<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20829611/">Web's ubiquitous &acirc;&euro;&tilde;colon-hyphen-parenthesis&acirc;&euro;&trade; celebrates a milestone</a><br />
This dork either deserves an award, or a bullet!<br />

<blockquote><p>Twenty-five years ago, Carnegie Mellon University professor Scott E. Fahlman says, he was the first to use three keystrokes &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; a colon followed by a hyphen and a parenthesis &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; as a horizontal "smiley face" in a computer message.</blockquote></p>
<p>So HE'S the guy I can blame for that! AND he perpetuates the crime!</p>
<blockquote><p>To mark the anniversary Wednesday, Fahlman and his colleagues are starting an annual student contest for innovation in technology-assisted, person-to-person communication. The Smiley Award, sponsored by Yahoo Inc., carries a $500 cash prize.</blockquote></p>
<p>Some believe that emoticon's are the natural progression of how we communicate online.</p>
<blockquote><p>Emoticons reflect the likely original purpose of language &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; to enable people to express emotion, said Clifford Nass, a professor of communications at Stanford University. The emotion behind a written sentence may be hard to discern because emotion is often conveyed through tone of voice, he said.</p>
<p>"What emoticons do is essentially provide a mechanism to transmit emotion when you don't have the voice," Nass said.</p>
<p>In some ways, he added, they also give people "the ability not to think as hard about the words they're using."</blockquote></p>
<p>I mostly believe they are the natural progression of my ex-wife trying to annoy me to death!</p>
