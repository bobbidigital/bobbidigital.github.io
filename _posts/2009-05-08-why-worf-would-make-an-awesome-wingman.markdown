<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-591" style="border: 2px solid black; margin: 2px;" title="250px-worftng" src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/250px-worftng.jpg" alt="Lt. Worf of the Starship Enterprise" width="209" height="252" />The wing man is a position that a good friend will always aspire to be. The great thing about a wingman is there is no requirement of being single. The job of the wing man is to deflect and push off any attention away from himself and place it squarely on that of you.&Acirc;&nbsp; His job is to give you the glory. I can't think of a better person suited for the job than a Klingon.</p>
<p>If Worf were your wingman you'd be all set. The singles scene would open wide for you. Look at any episode where Worf and Picard are together. The way he looks at Picard just screams "Dude..you are SO awesome!"&Acirc;&nbsp; It's the ultimate sign of respect dabbled with just a *pinch* of fear. Not enough to be a turn off, but just enough to be sexy to the ladies.</p>
<p>Another great benefit of having Worf as your wingman are the stories. Imagine the scene, Worf is left with the ladies while you're in the restroom.</p>
<p>"So Worf, where did you two meet?"</p>
<p>"In Combat!"</p>
<p>If that's not an awesome opener you really had no chance of getting a date with this girl anyways. Something about hearing Worf's deep bellowing voice professing his admiration of your "guile" in the Khitomer Massacre is sure to win you some brownie points. That far away look he gets as he begins to mentally recant the gritty details of a battle that, more than likely, he wasn't even a part of. But that's OK because it makes for great cannon fodder over drinks.</p>
<p>The benefits don't stop there though. Worf has a very imposing presence to him. He's mean and tough looking, potentially scaring any competition away. This is a good thing because it allows you to focus on your interaction with the ladies. If someone does approach your table, you don't even have to break a sweat, because you know Worf won't let any transgression go by unchallenged. The best part though; anyone who's watched a Next Generation episode knows that Worf's real worth is in taking double axe handle punches to the face. So while the bad guys are tiring themselves out beating his ass, you can come in, mop up and look like the savior. Thanks to Worf's size, nobody would suspect he fights like a 12 year old girl with an iron jaw. The bonus points continue.</p>
<p>Worf has a thing about worthiness. Once he's accepted you into his circle, it's difficult for him to be convinced that anyone else is worthy of that person's companionship. While not a great long term turn on, for the short term, it does instill a great sense of curiosity on the opposite sex. "What is it about this man that makes his Klingon friend so die hard and loyal." The reality is simple. Worf is dumb is as a brick, but as long as he's seen you punch a man for a sufficient cause by Klingon standards, you've pretty much got his attention for life.</p>
<p>"Your friend seems kind of weird Worf"</p>
<p>(Worf getting that deep sneer) "You DARE dishonor my friend. He has bested many in BATTLE. He's earned more glory than you could possibly fathom. You should be HONORED that he lets you drink in his presence!"</p>
<p>Again, in the long term, not so hot. But in some fancy club lighting and a martini or two later, that sounds like a man willing to die for his friend. And once you get Worf rolling on how you've "sacrificed" for him, you're a lock. The uniform is a nice touch too.</p>
<p>Now you're probably thinking that you have a friend that could play the same role, but the keyword is "play". Worf believes this whole hearteadly, making the exchange become that more powerful, endearing and ultimately effective.</p>
<p>Worf, if I were single, you could be my wingman anytime.</p>
<p>(In a perfect world Worf would be here to say "Bullshit. You can be mine" Alas, life is full of imperfections and this Top Gun reference will go unfulfilled)</p>
