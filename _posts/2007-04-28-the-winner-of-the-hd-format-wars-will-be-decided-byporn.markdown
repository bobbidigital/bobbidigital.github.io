The porn industry has always been an early adopter of new technologies.  For some reason these perverts can size up a technology and help us all as Americans decide what's going to stay and what's going to go.</p>
<p>I don't remember seeing too many porn laser discs. Porn beta? Don't think so. Sure there were a few companies that probably flirted with it, but porn decided to back VHS. Not long after, the Beta format fell to the wayside for consumers. Because if you can't watch people having sex on a device, then just what good is it?</p>
<p>The Internet, another great booming success. Who were some of the first ones out into the battlefield, distributing content as a series of streaming 1's and 0's? You guessed it, porn! While a lot of these other knuckle head companies were trying to figure out what to do with this "Internet" porn was all up on it, offering twisted fucks all the world over with every disgusting fetish they could possibly imagine.</p>
<p>The iPod. While NBC and CBS were trying to figure out if this whole "TV on demand" thing was going to work (because who REALLY wants to watch TV on their OWN schedule) porn was distributing iPod size videos so you could watch gang bangs during Sunday service and have the ole spank bank topped off before lunch.</p>
<p>Now we're on to a new revolution, HD. Blu-ray or HD-DVD? Sony or Microsoft?  Fox or Universal? Xbox360 or PS3? These are the types of choices we're forced to  make as consumers when we decide to wade into this format war.  The war is still early however. If memory serves the number of participants are still in the 10's of thousands just barely about to breach the 100,000 mark. (This number is for both Blue-ray and HD-DVD combined) So there is still plenty of time to see how things shake out. Most people will probably sit back, see who starts to lose and then join the winning team. But if nobody is playing how does either side win? Hello porn.</p>
<p>Porn addicts will pay anything to feed their addiction. It's like crack without the pipe but twice the mess afterwards.  With some of the features of HD-DVD I can see it being a clear choice. Being able to superimpose a face on a particular "performer" sounds like it would be a porn addicts' dream come true. I'm sure Blu-ray has a host of features for our wrist weary friends as well.</p>
<p>So the question is, who is porn really backing? That's the side that I want to be on. Because I'll bet dollars to donuts that Anal Vixens 17 will sell more copies than Casino Royale. If I were porn, I'd pick Blu-ray. Why? In a nutshell, because of the PS3.  Sony always releases games that seem to be designed specifically at pot smoking, porn watching fornicators. If they've already got the system, chances are they've got an HDTV. Which means they've already got all the components necessary for their HD love fest.</p>
