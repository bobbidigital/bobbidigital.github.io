<p>I received a rather uncharacteristic e-mail from Apple the other day.&Acirc;&nbsp; For those that don't know their migration to <em>Mobile Me</em> wasn't without it's fair share of problems.&Acirc;&nbsp; Unlike the iPhone debacles though, Apple has nobody to blame but themselves on this one.&Acirc;&nbsp; But instead of covering it up in a shroud of secrecy, we got this attempt at an explanation. Could this be the first sign of a softer, more communicative Apple? I doubt it, but one can hope.</p>
<p>If there is anything that's been a staple in my time as an Apple customer is that they're arrogant. That type of behavior clearly flows from the top down.&Acirc;&nbsp; Funny how AT&amp;T is to blame for the activation issues, yet every iPhone carrier in the world has had similar issues. The only common denominator is Apple.</p>
<p>That being said, it makes a letter such as this a big deal. Read below for, what I can only hope to be, the new Apple. Also take note of the free extension and their admittance to screwing the pooch on the word "push".</p>

Fortunately we have worked through those problems and the web apps are now up and&Acirc;&nbsp;running.</div></p>

While all email, contact or calendar changes on the iPhone and the web apps are immediately synced to and from the MobileMe "cloud," changes made on a PC or Mac take up to 15 minutes to sync with the cloud and your other devices. So even though things are indeed instantly pushed to and from your iPhone and the web apps today, we are going to stop using the word "push" until it is near-instant on PCs and Macs, too.</div></p>
