<p>Sylvester Stallone has a Death Wish. I've never heard a headline so perfectly summarize a story. Stallone....he wants to...he's in talks to....just read the press release from Variety.</p>
<blockquote><p>After a recent resurgence with sequels "Rocky Balboa" and the upcoming "Rambo," Sylvester Stallone is taking aim at an MGM remake of the 1974 Charles Bronson starrer "Death Wish."</p>
<p>Stallone is in talks to direct and star as an ordinary man who goes vigilante after his wife and daughter are attacked. Set to write the script are Michael Ferris and John Brancato, whose credits include "Terminator 3" and "Terminator Salvation: The Future Begins."</blockquote></p>
<p>And this is why I'm not worried about the writer's strike. I could bang my ass against a keyboard for 20 minutes and it would only take a LITTLE bit of editing to produce a script more thoughtful and original than the crap Hollywood is putting out. Read the rest of the story at <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117975351.html?categoryid=1238&cs=1">Variety here.</a></p>
<p>Now if you'll excuse me, my butt cheeks have a masterpiece just waiting to come out.</p>
