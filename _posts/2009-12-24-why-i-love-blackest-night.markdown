<p><img src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/images/Blackest_Night.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 5px 5px 5px 5px;" alt="Blackest Night - 2009" height=300px>I've really been enjoying the Blackest Night series as a whole. It's probably been one of my favorite series, mainly because so far, all of the tie-ins I've been reading make sense in their story-arcs. </p>
<p>So often during a major event, the crossovers are more a result of capitalism than artistic need. I understand the idea is to sell more comics not less, but all too often the tie-ins for event titles seemed forced, unnecessary and plain old boring. I'm not reading all the tie-ins, but the ones I have read (Superman, Batman, Booster Gold) the tie-ins are short and they deal with key portions of the character's past. It puts characters like Dick Grayson and Tim Drake up against parts of their history that drives and fuels them as characters. Booster Gold gets a visit from his best friend Ted Kord, whose death has haunted Booster for years.</p>
<p>I know that money is tight, we are in a recession and all. But if I could persuade you to expand your reading list just a bit, I would strongly suggest picking up some of the off-shoots of Blackest Night. If you a favorite character that has an off-shoot, pick it up. It could be the comic that pits your hero up with his past or even his greatest fears. You can check out the Blackest Night pull list <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackest_Night#Blackest_Night_2">on Wikipedia</a></p>
