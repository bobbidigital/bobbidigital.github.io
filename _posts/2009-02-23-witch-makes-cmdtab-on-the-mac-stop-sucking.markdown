  content: "Agree with you about Cmd-Tab. Hardly a productivity enhancer!\r\n\r\nFYI,
    can't seem to get the embedded video to load. I'll try the separate Vimeo link.
    I'm (still) running 10.4 on G4, so maybe that's why.\r\n\r\nI've been chomping
    at the bit to move up to a new iMac,  but need to keep running Classic. I thought
    I'd come up with a great solution, buy an old first-generation Mini for that,
    wouldn't take up much space.\r\n\r\nSo far, though, by the time the eBay auctions
    are over, most of those are running nearly as much as they cost new! I'm going
    to wait until Apple finally intros their new desktops, maybe there'll be a better
    iMac &amp; a new Mini that will flush out a bunch of the old ones and lower the
    price."

  content: "Actually, I find that I greatly prefer the Mac version of CMD-Tab.  The
    CMD-` switches between windows of my active application (something I have not
    been able to do in Windows).  This means I can switch to a window in another program
    with fewer button presses on average when compared to working on a Windows box.\r\n\r\nProbably
    a reason this works for me is that I don't minimize windows, I prefer to use the
    CMD-H key to hide them.  CMD-` does not cycle through minimized windows, which
    I agree is a bit of an oversight.\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing the info on Witch,
    though!  I'll pass it on to anyone who has a similar complaint."

<p>If you're a Mac user you're probably accustomed to the way CMD + TAB works on the map; frankly, it sucks. It doesn't maximize minimized windows and you can't cycle through windows, just applications. Witch will fix that for you.</p>
