  content: "You raise an interesting point, and yes, I believe most of us social pornographers
    have run into this dilemma. All I can recommend is to utilize the (albeit tedious)
    \"friend groups\" on FB, where you can exclude people from getting every one of
    your tantalizing updates, as you see fit... It's a pain to set up, but on the
    plus side, you only have to do it once!\r\n\r\n(I'd even be more than willing
    to walk you through this, if you'd like.)"

  content: "I have mixed feelings about integrating social network feeds. For the
    most part, I find that Twitter updates on Facebook feeds are too much noise, especially
    since I'm a big Twitter user and follow most of them there.\r\n\r\nOTOH, I have
    noticed lately an advantage, that I can comment on Facebook in a way that I wouldn't
    want to do on Twitter, where an @-reply would go to everyone. \r\n\r\nSo I'm still
    not sure about this. Maybe we'll just have to wait till the number of social networks
    is consolidated to something more manageable.\r\n\r\n@-replies are great ways
    of drawing others into conversations and letting them know about other Tweeters,
    but some things are of too limited interest to bother everyone with.\r\n\r\nI
    guess that points out my #1 rule of social network etiquette (applies similarly
    to email): Think enough about what/where you're posting to avoid wasting others'
    time!"

  content: "I like the idea of Pandora integrating with facebook, and especially the
    Digg plugin.  Now I wouldn't necessarily want everyone to be constantly bugged
    about what I'm digging at any particular moment, but it's nice when I bookmark
    a song on Pandora or Digg an interesting article to have that show up on my own
    personal profile page.\r\n\r\nSeems like the Pandora FB app has been broken lately,
    though ... not even sure I really care, too much.  Even the WP Pandora plugin
    I installed doesn't work for crap, so I'm not surprised.\r\n\r\nThough Pandora
    is definitely my favorite spot on the web."

<p>Most of the people who are reading this post are like me, social network junkies. We enjoy sharing our experiences online whether it be interesting links, our taste in music or our observations on life. These social tools have taken away from our more traditional sense of personal blogging. I no longer write posts to keep my friends in New York informed on what I'm doing. There's really no need now that I've got 300 different methods for updating them in smaller albeit more frequent messages. Now enter the 800lb gorillas of social networking, Facebook.</p>
<p>Facebook is becoming a mainstream tool for us to keep in touch with our people scattered across the globe. Many of our Facebook friends have no idea what a <a href="http://www.twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> is or think <a href="http://www.pandora.com" target="_blank">Pandora </a>is just a box with a lot of trouble inside. They look to see what's happening with you in the only place they know of, Facebook. We have to keep in mind though that our not-so-net savy friends may not be interested in everything that's going on with you. Some are annoyed by the fact that you're at Kingston Mines is invading their status page. There is however that select group of people that find it useful to be able to go to one place and get updated on the happenings of one's life. But again our not-so-net savy friends aren't aware of services such as <a href="http://www.friendfeed.com/bobbidigital" target="_blank">Friend Feed</a>. Enter the Facebook integration.</p>
<p>To make it easier for people to find my updates I decided to integrate a lot of my other services into Facebook. So now all my updates are collected via Friend Feed and then Friend Feed is part of my news feed updates on Facebook. It's easy for me and easy for everyone that's a friend to follow. But what about those people who are "friends" but don't really care to know every detail? Those old high school buddies that you don't really talk to, but you couldn't help but send a request to them just to see what they're up to. They are now inundated everytime you listen to music, rent a netflix movie or favorite a YouTube video. Do we care about their precious wall space or do we just allow them to de-friend us? What IS the social etiquette for this? Is there such an etiquette?</p>
<p>I'd love to hear your feedback. Comment or sound-off via Twitter with an <a href="http://www.twitter.com/bobbidigital" target="_blank">@bobbidigital</a>.&Acirc;&nbsp; Help me to become a better Internet friend.</p>
