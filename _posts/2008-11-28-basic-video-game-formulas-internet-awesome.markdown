<p>So I purchased Left 4 Dead for the XBOX360 awhile ago. I must say it's one of the most entertaining games I've ever played. But when playing it I felt that there was something incredibly familiar about it. The action is elegant in its simplicity. Make it from location A to location B without dying. Sounds easy enough.</p>
<p>After some thought it occurred to me that this game is really nothing more than a modern day Gauntlet. Yes it's from the 1st person perspective, but the game lacks any true story line or arch. Each campaign is an individual scenario in which you must escape. Simple and to the point. But the aspect of online play, having an entire screen for yourself and being able to split up from your team without having to scream "Come back to the left dude! I'm stuck". So if you have XBOX Live I highly recommend this title. If you don't you may or may not enjoy the game still. If you enjoyed playing Gauntlet alone, then you may still enjoy the single player version of this.</p>
<p>But it really got me thinking, when are we going to see more reincarnated versions of old school games and formulas? I happen to think Double Dragon on XBOX Live would be hot. &Acirc;&nbsp;Contra? &Acirc;&nbsp;IKARI Warriors? Two player Tomb Raider game? Wouldn't it be awesome to have puzzles that involve team work!&Acirc;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe I'm nuts but I got kind of excited about the possibilities.</p>
