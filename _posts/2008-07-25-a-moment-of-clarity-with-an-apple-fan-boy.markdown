  content: That would be nice. I have the macbook pro and I love the metal casing.
    I'm not sure if we're mature enough in touch interface for a central computing
    platform. Phones yes, but for your whole machine? I dunno. We'll see.

<p><img src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/picture-2.png" alt="Picture 2.png" border="0" width="242" height="180"class="alignleft" />Since becoming an official Apple Zealot about 4 or 5 years ago, I'm constantly amazed and in awe of it's power. I've been robbed of my senses on many different occasions by that shifty Steve Jobs fellow. I've lived a life filled with DRM but gave it a pass because "I only use Apple Products". I think every Mac fanboy from time-to-time goes through these "moments of clarity" and sees themselves as a breathing embodiment of what is wrong with the Internet. Today is definitely a moment of clarity for me. Sort of.</p>
<p>Every major tech news site has been covering the "announcement" from the <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5027498/apple-earnings-record-quarter-steve-promises-wonderful-new-products-this-year">Apple shareholders call</a> that profit margins would be a little tight as Apple prepared for a "revolutionary" new product. (Notice the quotes. I'm chuck full of skepticism today) Steve knows what he's doing here. He's firing the starting pistol for every single Mac rumors site that exists. (And they did not disappoint) </p>
<p>Apple is notoriously close to the chest with news on its product launches. This creates a never ending frenzy amongst Apple fans but also creates fear and caution whenever buying a new Apple product. It also gives sites like <a href="www.macrumors.com">macrumors.com</a> and <a href="appleinsider.com">appleinsider.com</a> a reason for existing. (Hypocrite Disclaimer: I love both these sites) The problem with rumor sites however is that the majority of the time they're wrong. Every once in awhile they get it right though and that instantly gives credibility to their next stab at some mythical product idea. You always see these great little bits:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to a MacDailyNews source who leaked wireless iTunes a week before its official announcement....</blockquote></p>
<p>Isn't it lovely? As a fan boy it sends a subliminal override code to your sense of reason. They could announce that Steve Jobs is Christ reincarnate and you'd instantly say "Well I mean come on. They got WIRELESS iTunes right!" </p>
<p>The problem with these bits of "leaked" information is this. It's a lot easier to imagine a product than it is to engineer it. So while some bloke at MacDailyNews can come up with the most awesome combination of iPod, cell phone, television, salad fork and dishwasher product during his lunch break, it's a lot harder for Apple to actually produce it. Fan boys like me are really excited during major events like MacWorld or WWDC just to say be a *little* disappointed when my iPhone doesn't have a Febreeze dispenser like Apple Insider said it would. </p>
<p>It's great to have a rabid fan base. I know whenever that happens you'll have people waiting to manipulate their emotions for personal gain. Kind of like hookers. But at the same time it puts the company many of us love dearly into a tough spot because it becomes <b>impossible</b> to live up to some of the hopes and dreams of the fans.</p>
<p>So remember when you're reading a rumor site, (including this one) take everything with a grain of salt. You never know when they might be blowing sunshine up your ass.</p>
<p>OK I can't help myself. This <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5027706/rumor-macbook-touch-coming-in-october">MacTouch looks AWESOME</a>. Steve better deliver in October or he will fall. OK back to not believing the hype. I just had to get that out.</p>
