<p>If you have Sprint it looks like there might be a way for them to get rid of YOU! Various websites are reporting that Sprint/Nextel has decided to drop 1,000+ Customers due to excessive amounts of customer service calls.
<p>Anyone in the tech arena knows that the cost of providing customer service can add up pretty quickly if its abused or not properly managed. Well these customers must be a CS Manager's nightmare! Sprint says the average user calls customer service less than once a month. The subscribers being dropped called 40-50 times as often. Wouldn't that almost mean you spend at least an hour per day on the phone with Sprint?</p></p>
<p>The good news is that Sprint isn't charging a early termination fee and allowing customers a month to find new service before their relationship with Sprint is terminated.</p></p>
<p>Now this raises several questions for me about big business and there ability to throw their weight around. How come we as consumers don't get some sort of early termniation charge? Now I've got to start a brand new contract with some other service provider? <br/><br />
</p></p>
<p>I'm not one of the lucky few who are getting the boot, but it does make me wonder. Could I put up with making a call at least once a day to customer service to get out of my contract? The iPhone might be worth that bit of hassle for a month or two. Hmmm<br/><br />
