<p>Well thank heavens. I'll cut straight to the chase. Google has now begun tackling mass transit in some of the major metro areas across the country. Now Google Maps can offer directions via public transportation in select cities.</p>
<p>The only thing that is missing is a decent mobile version of the application. I don't know why so many people seem to miss the importance of mobile versions of public transportation apps. Either way it's a sweet sweet idea. More in depth review forthcoming. Cause I love me some public transportation.</p>
<p>Check out Chicago's <a href="http://maps.google.com/help/maps/transit/chicago/">CTA in action on Google.</a></p>
