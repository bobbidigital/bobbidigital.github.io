<p>The Web 2.0 Expo wasn't that long ago. One of the presentations was really top notch. The presentation is actually a little older than that, but I know there are plenty of people who haven't seen it. It's really not only a great definition of what Web 2.0 really is, but it's also a damn good presentation.</p>
