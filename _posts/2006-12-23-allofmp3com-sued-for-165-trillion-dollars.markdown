<p><img width="232" height="198" align="left" src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/images/allofmp3.jpg" />This one is good. So for those that don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.allthingsdork.com/www.allofmp3.com">AllofMp3.com</a> is a Russian run website that sells music at RIDICILOUS prices. I guess the ruble isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t doing so hot, because I can put the new Jay-Z album for a little under $3 dollars on the site. And the best part about it is that it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s all legal. Technically.</p>
<p>See there is some silly Russian law that AllofMp3&acirc;&euro;&trade;s lawyers are exploiting to validate the sites legitimacy in Russia. (Although still illegal in other countries) As it stands now the Russian government has been in no position to shut them down. That is of course until Russia wanted to join the World Trade Organization. The RIAA went as far to have lobbyists ensure that in order for Russia to join the WTO, they would need to shutdown AllofMp3.com. Pretty fucked up huh?</p>
<p>So now the RIAA is striking back with what has to be one of the largest lawsuits in history. <a target="_blank" href="http://tech.cybernetnews.com/2006/12/22/allofmp3com-sued-for-165-trillion/">The RIAA is suing AllofMp3.com</a> for $150,000 dollars per song downloaded between June and October of 2006, which comes to a whopping $1.65 trillion dollars.</p>
<p>The RIAA continues to state that it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s operating in the best interest of artist&acirc;&euro;&trade;s but there have been several write ups that might prove that <a target="_blank" href="http://torrentfreak.com/why-most-artists-profit-from-piracy/">piracy actually helps artists</a>. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not convinced of that but it wouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t take much to sway me.</p>
<p>Either way I believe the RIAA is suing because they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re lazy. Too lazy to reinvent the business model which they have loved and become accustomed to. The digital era is changing the way we listen to music and the RIAA&acirc;&euro;&trade;s business models need to also evolve to support this. They&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve taken some steps towards becoming more &acirc;&euro;&tilde;digitally compliant&acirc;&euro;&trade; (see the iTunes Music store for proof) but they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re still trying to fight that tooth and nail. Changing pricing structures, limiting number of devices for music, arcane DRM rules for sharing music, the list goes on and on as to how the RIAA drags their feet against the digital age. But one thing I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve learned from the Internet is that things evolve with or without you. Maybe you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll have to come to terms with only making a portion of your usual profits. Technology is known to sometimes lessen the return on goods or services due to new factors. Maybe music is one of them.</p>
<p>And the ruble is worth 0.0380368425 dollars.</p>
