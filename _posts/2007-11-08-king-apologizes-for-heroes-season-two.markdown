<p>I'm glad it's not only me. I've been kind of "eh" about Heroes since the beginning. The only thing that keeps me tuning in is just sheer curiosity. Not that I'm at the edge of my seat or that I'm totally vested in the characters. The acting is sub-par, the plot-line is OK and the characters are pretty mediocre. (Except Hiro..he's awesome) But for some reason, all through season 1 I kept watching.  That ended in Season Two though. And from the sounds of things, series creator Tim Kring doesn't blame me. <br/><br />

<p>In an article in Entertainment Weekly Kring talks about his disappointment with Season Two, its pacing and its introduction of new characters. I'm sure the writers strike isn't helping him sleep any easier. Link to the EW article tells the whole story, but here are some of his complaints.</p></p>
<ul>
<li>The Pace is too slow</li>
<li>The World-Saving stakes should have been established sooner</li>
<li>The rookies didn't greet themselves properly</li>
<li>Hiro was in Japan way too long</li>
<li>Young love stinks</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Well...i think that just about somes it all up now doesn't it.</p></p>
