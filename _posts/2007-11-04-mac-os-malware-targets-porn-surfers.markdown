<p>An article from <a href="http://crave.cnet.com/8301-1_105-9808489-1.html?tag=blgs">Crave.Cnet.Com</a> reports.</p>
<blockquote><p>Intego, a Mac security software company, issued an alert Wednesday warning Mac users of the OSX.RSPlug.A malware, which it describes as a Trojan horse. Those of you familiar with mythology recognize the reference, and OSX.RSPlug.A disguises itself as a video codec that would ensure whatever porn video you just stumbled upon will play on your Mac.</blockquote></p>
<p>It seems you still have to be retarded enough to install the "new codec" on your system for it to worm it's way in, but us Mac users aren't as safe as we thought we were now that people are making malware specifically targeting Mac's. </p>
<p>Why can't they leave our porn pure and untainted?</p>
