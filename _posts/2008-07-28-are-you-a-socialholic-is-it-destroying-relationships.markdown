excerpt: |
  Sitting in a restaurant and scanning it's patrons can tell you a lot about the people you're sharing a room with. You can tell when a couple is having an argument, when a first date is going bad, when a first date is going good and those rare couples where the first date has never ended. Body language gives us these cues and insights into relationships. Someone who crosses their arms across their chest tells us something. A woman who touches her date on the hand every time she laughs or tells a story tells us something. So what does two people texting away on their cell phone tell us?

  content: "I've been surrounded by \"techies\" my entire life, even considered myself
    one for a very long time.  I even was ahead of the curve in terms of adopting
    certain new technologies.  Maybe not to the extent that others are, but I'm definitely
    surrounded by it and well aware of the positive impacts technology has had in
    our lives - the unlimited amount of positive things. \r\n\r\nI must say though
    I'm on the other side of the argument here.  Even at an early age, I realized
    how technology has been negatively affecting our social relationships.  I'm not
    referring to all of the positive things it's done (people meeting online and falling
    in love, finding your long lost friend from grade school, etc.).  What I'm referring
    to is this generations growing inability to have genuine meaningful one on one
    time with other people...and their growing ignorance to how it affects the people
    they're with.  \r\n\r\nTake caller ID or call waiting for example and to start.
    \ That was where it started (at least for me).  It was considered rude \"back
    in the day\" to put someone you're having a conversation with on hold in order
    to pick up for another person.  Yes, it's wonderful in some cases when you're
    waiting for the doctor to call back or for that job offer to come through.  But
    haven't we all been on that other side of the conversation when you're telling
    your best friend about a serious issue you're having and CLICK there comes another
    call.  \"Wait I gotta get that.\" And in the meantime, your feelings have been
    put on pause.\r\n\r\nCell phones in restaurants in something that I'll probably
    never get used to.  I'll never forget the first time I saw two people (not children
    mind you, but adults in their early twenties) sitting at a restaurant each of
    them talking on the phone to other people.  I watched in amazement.  It wasn't
    for 10 seconds to find out \"Who's going to the movie?\" but it was full blown
    conversations with other people.  Why not just invite those 2 other people to
    your dinner?  Why did you even go to dinner in the first place if talking to the
    person you're with isn't what you wanted to do?\r\n\r\nWe, as a society, feel
    that we MUST be available at all times.   Whatever happened to being IN the moment
    - to enjoying the company of who you're with not worrying about whether or not
    someone just found out they have a rash on their arm and decided to twitter it
    and tell everyone?  If the conversation sucks or you don't want to be there, then
    leave.  If you're not going to be present, then you shouldn't be there at all.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not by any means saying I'm not guilty of it and I realized at a recent family
    dinner just how rude I was.  I was at my aunt's house with about 8 of my family
    members.  Twitter was constantly going off - blogs being posted, people saying
    they are going to buy the new iPhone, whatever.  None of it was critical or of
    such utmost importance that I needed to know. My phone kept constantly going off
    and even though it was on vibrate, I would look at it and occasionally respond.\r\n\r\nMy
    aunt stopped in mid sentence after about 2 hours of this and said \"Put your phone
    down.  If you don't want to be here, then leave.  Are we not good enough for you?\"
    \ I didn't realize until I did put my phone away that I was missing good conversation
    - yes I was listening but wasn't fully engaged.  I also didn't realize how rude
    I looked doing that.  \r\n\r\nNo matter how you spin it, if you're interested
    in what other people are doing or responding to txt messages while you're out
    with other people...that's a form way of saying \"This conversation with you people
    isn't stimulating enough for me.\"  That's exactly how I made my family feel.
    \  It's the equivalent, in my opinion, of being out with someone and periodically
    checking the other room of the bar out to see what's going on there.  Or to see
    what someone else is doing at their table.  Yes, one might say \"But I don't care
    about these txt's or these twitters\" but the person you're with doesn't know
    that.  For all they know you could be making other plans with someone via txt
    so you can ditch 'em.  \r\n\r\nI'm made a promise to myself to stay fully engaged
    from now on when I'm out with my friends (and especially family!).  Yes, I still
    txt people when I'm out and yes I still check my phone.  I try to do it in the
    bathroom or when people are away from the table - that doesn't always happen -
    but I try.  \r\n\r\nFor all you techies out there, you may think you're multi-tasking
    and able to fully comprehend the conversation and enjoying the people you're with.
    \ But try for one night to leave your phone at home or turn it off while you're
    out and see how crippled you feel.  Pretty soon we won't even need to meet out
    for drinks anymore...drinking a beer at home while in a virtual chatroom with
    your friends will become our next happy hour.  Where does it end?"

  content: "Jeff - \r\n\r\nYou're lucky, because you seem like a person that can juggle
    the friends and the technology. It's a shame -- and I've seen this in my Tweet-ups
    -- when people treat each other in a way that aligns with Shiny Object Syndrome;
    it's clear they're looking for the next big thing to advance themselves and don't
    really care about making the connection.\r\n\r\nNice rant...err...post."

  content: "I think it just depends who your with. At Twitter meet-ups, I feel more
    comfortable staring at my phone, or taking pics and uploading, etc. To others
    point of view, I would imagine it's not as rude for me to be doing that, since
    they understand, being involved with technology themselves.\r\n\r\nBut for non-technology
    meetups, such as family gatherings, there has to be some level of discipline where
    you know when it's \"safe\" to look at your phone, and conduct your regular mo-blogging
    habits. I tend to keep my phone nearby, but I don't expose it too often for people
    to see that I'm engaged in something else.\r\n\r\nBut overall I see your point
    in how social relationships are changing due to technology's \"always on\" influence.\r\n\r\nAnd
    more to your point, just because technology people (at Twitter meetups for example)
    \"understand\" the behavior of being engrossed in your mobile device, that doesn't
    make it OK for social relations. Even at Twitter meetups, I'll exercise caution
    and avoid over-using my phone when there are real, physical people to interact
    with.\r\n\r\nAfter all, my goal with all social media is to meet like-minded people
    and form real, physical-world relationships.\r\n\r\nAnd I agree that virtual world
    relationships are no less real than physical world relationships, other than the
    lack of visual cues and bodily nuances that face-to-face interaction exposes.
    The question just becomes, can we sustain relationships without face-to-face interaction?
    Time will tell..."

<p>Sitting in a restaurant and scanning it's patrons can tell you a lot about the people you're sharing a room with. You can tell when a couple is having an argument, when a first date is going bad, when a first date is going good and those rare couples where the first date has never ended. Body language gives us these cues and insights into relationships. Someone who crosses their arms across their chest tells us something. A woman who touches her date on the hand every time she laughs or tells a story tells us something. So what does two people texting away on their cell phone tell us?<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-401"></a></p>
<p>It's painfully obvious how technology has reshaped the world we live in. It's created entirely new forms of communication and is arguably threatening to phase out the old. Instant messaging, text messaging, blogging , micro-blogging are all ways in which the advancements in technology have reshaped our communication platforms. The problem technophiles run into though is that the etiquette and social contracts for these platforms haven't matured. Some of these platforms haven't even reached complete acceptance in social circles.</p>
<p>If you're in a group of people and their cell phone rings, do you find it rude for them to check to see who it might be? If it's someone important or a call their expecting is it rude for them to take the call? I don't think so. Sure there's a break in your engagement with that person, but we easily pick up where we left off. Now what if it's a text message? An e-mail? A twitter post? To some these forms of communication are deemed as secondary or not quite as important. Being a technophile I see them as the same and I'll check out text messages or twitter direct messages, just because I have no idea what the message could be about? For me it's another form of communication, just as much as a cell phone or a house phone. I frequently get messages from people who need a small bit of information, but they happen to need it right in that moment. "I'm at the theater now. Is Shawn going to the movie? Should I get 2 tickets or 3?" Granted the world will continue to rotate if this question isn't answered, but much like the cell phone, the evolution of technology has raised our social expectations on availability.</p>
<p>How many times have you heard someone say "I called your cell phone and you didn't answer!" I've had this conversation a lot. Based on the person's reaction I had to re-read my cell phone contract. I was certain that I would find a passage in it's pages that outlined my requirement to answer the phone at all times unless a suitable excuse was available. Something that stated if I was in a movie, it was acceptable for me not to answer the phone. However if I was sitting at home doing nothing, answering the phone was a strict requirement. As you know doubt have guessed I found no such clause in my contract. But that clause does exist in our social contracts with one another. You have a cell phone, therefore your availability should be constant.</p>
<p>But let's look at the other side of the coin. You're in a group and someone is constantly looking at their phone. It's vibrating every 10 minutes and you don't feel like the person is invested or entertained by the conversation in the present. The problem with being social media whores is that your Internet circle of friends tends to be a bit larger than your in person circle of friends. (I hate the term "real life". The Internet is also "real life") As a result the potential for minor interruptions is larger. Even if you don't respond, you could be getting dozens of e-mails a night with a slew of Twitter, Facebook, MySpace or blog posts as well. The picture becomes rude in a relatively short amount of time. The person appears disconnected from the group conversation. If we were the onlooker in the restaurant, we would assume the guy on his cell phone must be a friend of a friend. Someone that doesn't know the group well but decided to tag along. Would this behavior be tolerated at a family dinner? Depends if your family is on Twitter.</p>
<p>As I become more socially connected through these various networking sites, I fear that I might become more socially disconnected with my personal interactions. When I'm with Twitter followers, it's not as big a deal, or is it? The point of these social connections on the Internet is to also develop these connections in person. But aren't these connections further dulled by our constant search or development of the next connection? As we become more enthralled in our social networking do we become less social?</p>
<p>Social networking prostitution prevents me from looking at things objectively. I'm going to be more conscious of this with my non-techie friends, get an idea of their viewpoint and how they perceive me in social settings. It's probably not the image I want to project, just oblivious to the idea that everyone doesn't live the same way. You wouldn't show up to your Jewish friend's house with a pork roast would you? </p>
