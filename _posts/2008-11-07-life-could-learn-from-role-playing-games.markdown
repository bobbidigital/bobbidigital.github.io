excerpt: "I often think about how much easier life could be if we found a simple way
  to&Acirc;&nbsp; . There's no better example of how this could work than in the realm
  of Role playing Games.&Acirc;&nbsp; RPG developers have learned that life boils
  down to rewards. We perform and do tasks in life for some type of reward, even those
  self-less bastards out there volunteering for things.\r\n\r\nThe reward tools in
  life are the same in video games, money, experience and reputation. (also called
  faction in some systems) Those 3 items influence a lot of aspects of your life,
  how you view yourself and how others view you. Now imagine how much easier it would
  be if these things were measured in life the same way they were measured in role
  playing Games.\r\n"

  content: "TEHEHE\r\n\r\nBlonde Elf seeking reply, hahahahaha, so how would one measure
    experience points, would they preset like in WOW or based on the time and subject
    matter?  I LOVE this idea, it does make perfect sense."

  content: I think they'd have to preset, but there would need to be a situational
    bonus as well. So for example, changing a tire would be 50+ Mechanical XP. But
    changing a tire under heavy artillery fire would totally be 500+ Mechanical XP
    with some Courage and Defense bonus. Unless you run into Turkish Rebels on a daily
    basis I'm not sure that this scenario would ever happen, but you get my drift.
    You should probably lose XP for really really dumb shit.

    have  15,000 Experience points in Tech/Programming\r\nMust have  2,000 Experience
    points in management\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThis sounds like an awful idea! Well
    maybe not for tech stuff but definitely for other areas of employment/career!\r\n\r\nI'd
    hate to never get anywhere in the beginning and be stuck at level 1 till I finished
    5 years of fast-food employment. \r\n\r\nI'd rather go straight to Epic level
    20, own my own business, travel across the world, and so on. Leave the requirements
    (standard xp bar) at home and instead read books/interact with the world.
    One could gain tons of easy XP just by breaking the mold of a typical lifestyle.\r\n\r\nBooks
    and stories shared by others ARE our manuals and bonus xp points. We have the
    choice though if we want to sit/rush around and do little with our lives or
    embrace the varied aspects of it."

    could weed a lot of stuff out :-)

  content: "Hmm, now that you mention it yes it could make some situations easier
    to deal with without much of a loss of xp. Especially for dealing with strangers.\r\n\r\nBeing
    able to inspect someone would definitely help. I'd be able to find out if my mother-in-law
    was really a dragon and make sure not to bring up the discussion of Knights. ;)\r\n\r\nAnd
    I have to say I found your \"200xp Romance\" comment rather ironic in that my
    hubby and I sometimes say \"50xp!\" when we learn something super new/useful
    or we will say \"lose 50xp\" when either of us does something silly like tell
    a really bad joke or get stuck on the line with a telemarketer.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the discussion, Jeff.^^"

<p>I often think about how much easier life could be if we found a simple way to&Acirc;&nbsp; . There's no better example of how this could work than in the realm of Role playing Games.&Acirc;&nbsp; RPG developers have learned that life boils down to rewards. We perform and do tasks in life for some type of reward, even those self-less bastards out there volunteering for things.</p>
<p>The reward tools in life are the same in video games, money, experience and reputation. (also called faction in some systems) Those 3 items influence a lot of aspects of your life, how you view yourself and how others view you. Now imagine how much easier it would be if these things were measured in life the same way they were measured in role playing Games.<br />

You read a job description and the job description could quite possibly be some convuluted mess of words that some intern put together. You don't really know what you'll be doing, what will be required of you or if it'll be worth your time in the long run. The only thing you are fairly clear on is how much money you will receive for performing that task. But what if the job description read like this:</p>
<p>Qualifications:</p>
<p>Must Equip: An Associates Degree<br />
Must Have 200 Experience points in mid-size or large multi-platform data center<br />
Must have > 15,000 Experience Points in Tech<br />
Must have > 15,000 Experience points in Tech/Programming<br />
Must have > 2,000 Experience points in management</p>
<p>Reward:</p>
<p>+5,000 Experience points in Tech after 3 years<br />
+1,000 Experience points in Tech/Programming after 3 years<br />
+200 Faction Points with Group:Geeks<br />
+50 Faction Points with Group: Business Professionals<br />
-50 Faction points with Group: Attractive Females<br />
+50 Faction points with Group: Attractive Males<br />
$2000 per week</p>
<p>Now doesn't that make the job a lot easier to quantify? You know what you need, what you'll get and how it will affect your life. Think about what it could do to the dating scene? The requirements are just out there in your face! Internet dating could be revolutionized!</p>
<p>Screen Name: Beautiful Betty<br />
Location: Chicago, IL<br />
Looking for: Attractive male with No more than 5,000 experience points in Athleticism but no less than 500 points in Athleticism<br />
Must have at least 20,000 total experience points in life. (But the XP must come from the Professional, Romantic and Financial Skill set groups)<br />
Must Equip: Bachelors Degree<br />
Cannot Equip: Cigarettes<br />
Cannot Equip: Drug Use<br />
Must Equip: Religious Implement</p>
<p>This makes life easy. You can quickly tell if you're in this girl's league or not.Who wants to hear arbitrary things like "looking for a sense of humor". Well do you want me to be Woody Allen or do you want me to be Richard Pryor. There's levels here! Isn't "Humor 2000 experience points or higher" a lot easier to quantify.</p>
<p>The only hard part is we've got to figure out how to award the XP without it being a public display. I tend to imagine people at a romantic dinner and little signs that say "+200 XP Romance" popping up over their head. Not very discrete. Either way, I think life could take a lesson from some RPG developers. Could make it that much easier to know who and what you're ready for. And more importantly, what else you need to work on.</p>
