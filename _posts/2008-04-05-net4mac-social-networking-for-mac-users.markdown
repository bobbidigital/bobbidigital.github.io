<p>Ok, so now it's official. Mac users are a bit stuck up. As if there wasn't enough information out there to prove this point, the introduction of a social network specifically for mac users makes it official. </p>
<p>Net4Mac is a social networking application targeted specifically at mac users. The major difference between this and most social networking applications is that this is actually a downloaded application versus a web app. (Hence the Mac only portion) The good news is that you know you instantly have something in common with every user on the system. You're all mac users. But like most social networking apps, it's not what the application does, but more of who is on it.</p>
<p>Net4Mac is way too new to have reached critical mass yet. Searching for users in the Chicago area left me with a whopping 4 people to talk to. Actually make that 3 because I can't include myself. While the application itself is kind of a snoozer, the idea of a different type of social networking experience is appealing to me. It's well documented in this blog my distaste for web based applications. The idea of a fat client however replacing some of our favorite web apps puts a smile on my face. Not saying that the web portion shouldn't be an option, because there is some added bonus to the accessibility of web based applications. Nothing illustrates the point better than the iTunes Store vs. the Amazon MP3 store. The experience captured in the iTunes store is simply more rich in my opinion.</p>
<p>Anyways, if you're interested check out Net4Mac. I doubt it's something you'll fall in love with, but it does make you wonder what an experience it could be with a site like Facebook or MySpace.  </p>
<p>Check it out at <a href="http://www.net4mac.com/english.html">www.net4mac.com</a></p>
<p>For those who don't have a Mac but are at least interested in the concept, I'll be doing a screen cast of the app soon.</p>
