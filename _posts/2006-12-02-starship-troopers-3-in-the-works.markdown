  content: Havne't read the book myself either. But knowing me, I wouldn't like it.
    I can only read the book, or watch the movie. If i do both I'm pissed off at one.

  content: I haven't read the book but thought the first movie was brilliant, like
    an onion it was multi layered, great sci fi, totalitarian society, a deadly enemy
    with no technology etc. But the second movie was a right lot of tosh. Hope the
    third movie will be better as I read Casper Van ... is back as Ricco

<p>I read this morning that there is a Starship Troopers 3 in the works. Now I feel as if my dork alarm isn't quite up to snuff, because I had no idea there was a Starship Troopers 2, let alone murmors of a third film.</p>
<p>Now I will spend the entire day, hunting for this 2nd film. (Which went straight to DVD) Some movies are sooo bad, their good. Starship Troopers in my eyes is one of those films. Read more on the <a href="http://www.cinecon.com/news.php?sid=224">Cinecon blog</a>.</p>
