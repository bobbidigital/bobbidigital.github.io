  content: I agree on everything except one point...  make it two vs. many, and I'm
    in.  Marcus is cool and all, but it seems like it would be a much different world
    without Dom.

<p><a href="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/gears-of-war.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-463 alignleft" style="margin: 5px; border: 5px solid black;" title="gears-of-war" src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/gears-of-war-300x240.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="240" /></a>Gears of Wars 2 is one of those awesome shooters that comes around every so often. The game has a perfect blend of action, strong story and quality voice acting that is surprisingly elusive in the video game space, although over the years more titles are joining the ranks. I enjoyed the game quite a bit, just as much as I enjoyed the first title. You know a game is great when they can create a sequel, not really change anything and you're still not bored. That's because the graphics, art style and atmosphere create another world that is both engaging, believable and entertaining. This among other things is one of the reasons the Gears of Wars series could make an epic movie.</p>
<p>Action films of today are grossly different than the films I grew up on as a kid. In the 80's and early 90's action movies were over the top plots with over the top stars. No tricky wire stunts or green screen work. It was a big muscle headed action star kicking ass like only he could. I miss being intimidated by action stars. If you watch the first two Terminator films you'll notice how everyone is in awe as Arnold walks around looking for clothes. Not just because he's naked, but because he's a specimen of pique physical stature. You're afraid of a man like that. Now tell me, would you honestly be worried if Jason Statham showed up at your house? Tom Cruise? &Acirc;&nbsp;Will Smith? &Acirc;&nbsp;But what about the boys from back in the day? Sylvester Stallone, Dolph Lundgren, Arnold&Acirc;&nbsp;Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers? Hell even Steven Segal would make you a little nervous with that evil scowl. These guys were bad asses in a way that hasn't been reproduced in my opinion. The Rock might have had a chance if it weren't for his start being in films where he pretty much was The Rock. (Remember the eyebrow?)</p>
<p>The art and style of Gears of Wars would demand a return to these types of actors to remain true to the story. Marcus Fenix is larger than life and voiced beautifully by John Di Maggio. (Who is well known as the voice of Bender in Futurama) It's going to take a man with some serious life experience to pull off a role like that. Hell you might even want to go look for ex-marines and throw in a week of acting training. Or just get some muscle bound freak, it doesn't matter. The acting isn't what's going to carry a film like this. It's about image and it's about presence. Feats of strength and toughness will need to be the order of the day. Take me back to the days of insane gun battles. A huge man standing in the middle of a gun fight just mowing down everything he sees with some equally ridiclously sized gun. Shit yeah.</p>
<p>I'm not looking for some deep understanding of Locust culture or for an accurate depiction of the trials of war. I want to see Marcus Fenix kick ass, drop a few one liners and say "Control this is Delta" about 1000 times. I want a bunch of "1 vs. Many" battles where there is no reason a person survived it other than sheer awesomeness. But more importantly, I want to believe that this person is capable of that sheer awesomeness. I know people love their 150 pound models turned action stars and in all fairness their movies are good in a different kind of way. But I want to feel like I did when I watched Predator. A platoon of Balco taking dudes who are used to kicking ass and taking names.</p>
<p>I can only sit back and hope that someone will deliver the goods to me, the way I want them.</p>
<p>For those of you who have never played Gears of War, here's a quick clip from the first game to give you an idea of what I'm talking about.</p>
