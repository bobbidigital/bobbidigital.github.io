  content: interesting review. i can appreciate your critique of the way the director(mis)navigated
    through the twist. i haven't seen the movie &amp; don't know what the "secret
    twist" is yet but when i check the movie i have a feeling i'll agree with you.
    if it's obvious that the characters are crafted around the secret &amp; not the
    other way around, they've lost me too. this is the most helpful review of the
    movie i've read. thanks

  content: 'Thanks for posting this. I haven''t been able to put my thoughts into
    words about what I thought about the movie. You did a very good job of getting
    the point across. I felt the exact same way. To make it worse, I watched it with
    people who had already seen it. So, I had to hear: "Pay attention to this part."
    "Watch what happens here." "This is going to be important for the end."'

  content: Awww - you're being too harsh! The movie was great and I'd recommend going
    to see it again. The only problem is that if you don't pay attention from the
    beginning you'll be lost. Normally I don't like movies where I have to do the
    thinking - but I didn't mind as much. This would be a movie that I'd love to see
    again - and it sparks sooo much conversation. I was lost from the very beginning
    and it wasn't until Will Smith's brother showed up at Rosario Dawson's house that
    I realized that Will Smith wasn't the real guy that worked for the government.
    Pretty cool twists - but I loved it.

    Hey Darius. I guess I really didn't see the identity swap as part of the twist. They gave that away in the previews. There was a line in the preview that said "Why does she think you're name is Ben Thomas?". That scene ultimately got cut from the movie, but the damage was done in the trailer. As soon as he told Dawson her bed time story that was also blown to me.

    I wasn't confused during it because I knew they were being deliberately vague in the beginning. I can tell when the puzzle doesn't come with all the pieces, so I just patiently waited for the parts to come in. But even before all the pieces were in place I could tell it was a puzzle of a hot air balloon.

    I just felt like the movie could have been SO much more.

  content: I agree.  At least, you were not depressed watching it with your mother.  I
    had just broke up with my boyfriend and didn't know what the movie was about.  Fun
    time...

    a breakup. All too well. Keep your chin up though!

  content: I totally agree with your write-up.  I was able to figure out within the
    first 20 min. what was going on.  I may have been better to put it out there and
    really delve deeper into the resulting story lines from his decision.  It was
    a good move though.

<p>So I finally went to see <em>Seven Pounds</em> today. I wasn't originally interested in the film. I have a problem going to see a movie where the trailer doesn't tell you much of anything. Before the theatrical release, I would always ask people who seemed interested in it what the movie was about. The response was almost always "it's one of those movies you have to see to find out". OK I'll bite.</p>
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The film got some mixed reviews but most critics I read gave praise to its "twist ending". I won't give any spoilers here but my question is, what trick ending? The supposed twist was obvious within the first 30 minutes of the film. A friend of mine had guessed the twist just from watching the trailer. Now a mediocre twist isn't quite enough to ruin a film for me. I watched <em>The Village</em> and had the ending figured out within the opening sequence. But the difference between the two is that the twist in <em>The Village </em>was very organic, where as with <em>Seven Pounds,</em> you could feel them making concessions which in turn impacted the quality of the writing and the film as a final work.</p>
<p>Have you ever tried to communicate a secret to a specific person in a room full of people? Your speech becomes disjointed, vague and generally non-communicative of your actual intent. That's how most of the scenes in <em>Seven Pounds</em> felt to me. The characters are navigating around this big white elephant in their speech, crafting it in a way to not reveal too much. What results however are characters that sound exactly as they are; someone writing dialogue trying to hide a secret. They all dance around this big elephant and try to pretend like it doesn't exist. Now let me take it one step further. Have you ever watched two people trying to talk about a secret in code, but you already know the secret? Instead of having your interest piqued, you instead laugh at how dumb the two participants are thinking that they're actually accomplishing some level of intrigue.</p>
<p>The most devastating part is that if the writer just put the "secret" out in the open, we could have focused more time and energy on the core of the story which was actually pretty compelling when it wasn't being interrupted with Ben's covert actions and plotting. I feel like we could have put some real focus into Ben's development and progression had we just put his life story up in front from the beginning.</p>
<p>All in all it wasn't a bad movie. I'd recommend waiting for DVD or perhaps some discounted theatre prices. Just don't keep waiting for this huge roller coaster twist, because it's not coming.</p>
