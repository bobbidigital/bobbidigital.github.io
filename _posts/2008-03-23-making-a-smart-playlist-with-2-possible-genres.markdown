<p>A friend of mine asked me about this awhile ago so I thought I'd blog about it really quick like.So you're in iTunes and you've fell in love with the goodness that is Smart Playlists. Welcome to a brave new world. But now you're a little tied up because you've classified all your music into their appropriate genre and your trying to make a baby making playlist for that special someone.But low and behold, some of the music is classified as R&amp;B and some of it as Slow Jams or whatever you decided to name it. The Smart Playlist feature in iTunes currently doesn't have an option for OR, just AND. So how do you get the OR functionality working? You do it with multiple playlist.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.thejeffandstephshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/itunesgrab.jpg" height="138" width="324" border="0" alt="itunesgrab.JPG" /></p>So simple stupid stuff here. Create a smart playlist that matches anything that will be part of your OR criteria. So you can create a list that says "Matches ANY of the following: Genre IS Slow Jams,  Genre IS R&amp;B". Boom. Now you've got your R&amp;B and Slow Jams Playlist. Then you can simply create a new playlist with the rest of your criteria and as an additional criteria make sure the "PLAYLIST IS" option is set to your R&amp;B Slow Jams smart playlist.It's kind of ghetto, but it works when you're in a bind. Happy iTunes.</p>
