<p>If everyone knows it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s fucked, then why doesn't everyone chip in to fix it? This is a conversation that takes place frequently at my job. No matter who you talk to (unless they have the letters VP in their title) you'll get the same response. "We have cultural issues that need to be addressed". Well I guess if things are so fucked up culturally, how come it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not easier to fix? Sounds like everyone is willing to chip in to fix the problem. So why is it so hard?</p>
<p>Because talk is cheap. Because it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s so much easier to talk about how something should be then it is to be the lone voice of descent in a room full of people. How do we get past that barrier? How do you stand up and say "This is fucked up and I'm not living with it anymore." Most of the time you don't want to be the prick that's standing in the way of what the rest of the group considers "progress". So you cast your vote, you sign your name in humble and silent submission. You're a slave to the routine. You're part of the rubber stamp party.</p>
<p>And worse of all, you're part of the culture you just finished bitching about. The love of my life yearns for my touch. I'll finish this conversation later.</p>
