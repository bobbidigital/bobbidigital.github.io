<p>This is a funny video created by someone who watches too much Seinfeld.<br />

<p>But with that, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s made me think about the whole saga that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s been going on.</p>
<p>In case you don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m black. And I felt as an African-American that I should write this post about our dear friend &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Kramer&acirc;&euro;. Now a bit of a disclaimer. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve never really been a fan of Seinfeld. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not that I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t think he&acirc;&euro;&trade;s funny; I enjoy his stand up a lot. His show wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t very fun. I look at it along the same lines as I look at &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Friends&acirc;&euro;. There just wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t much appeal to it for black audiences. So in summary I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll say, I know nothing of Michael Richards or his work.</p>
<p>What Mr. Richards did was appalling. It was disgusting, immoral, uncalled for and just plain ole &acirc;&euro;&oelig;not cool&acirc;&euro;. I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t see how these types of outbursts cannot be indicative of some deep underlying hatred or racism. It might even be at a subconscious level. See many people have racial bias and don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t even realize. I can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t count how many times someone has told me a story and said &acirc;&euro;&oelig;So this old black lady is in the store&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;&acirc;&euro; and the entire story goes on and at the end I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m thinking to myself, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;What does the lady being black have to do with this story?&acirc;&euro;&Acirc;&nbsp; And the response is always &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m trying to describe her&acirc;&euro;. But I never hear a story where a white person needs to have their race accurately described. Am I saying that the above person is a racist? No not at all, but it does show a sort of racial bias.</p>
<p>Either way he&acirc;&euro;&trade;s got some issues. But what he said was NOT illegal. It was tasteless, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s his God given right to say those things. Which is why I think it is absolutely hilarious that these jack offs he offended are looking for &acirc;&euro;&oelig;financial compensation&acirc;&euro;. I want to laugh right in their faces. Is your racial pride so thin that these types of wounds can be covered by the dollars of a racist? You want your financial success to be provided off the back of someone who &acirc;&euro;&oelig;hates&acirc;&euro; you?</p>
<p>In my opinion these gentlemen lost all their credibility as well as their dignity the moment they asked for financial compensation. Shame on you turning his vile act into another blemish on the black community.</p>
