  content: WOW, I feel just the opposite. I like Star Trek Voyager very much, In fact
    unhappy cause it's over. Star Trek Voyager picks me up. This whole thing about  getting
    lost further out into the abiss makes allot of  sense. Meeting hostile aliens,
    Knowing there is A god. "Q" When they bring some of the other to this it's just
    awesome. Sometimes taking away from the main point helps break the monotony. It's  hard
    to say there's anything I dislike about Star Trek. BUT there is one I've noticed
    and I will share. They need to lay off the Aliens with the thingy on the bridge
    of the nose.. Seems like ever other alien has something with the nose. LOL.  Also.
    To make this short. I never did like the original.. BUT since "Voyager I've become
    to "Appreciate" Gene great work"

<p><img width="306" height="229" align="right" src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/images/StarTrekVoyager.jpg" />Most of you know that I loathe Voyager. Much of my decision was based ignorantly on a few things. My biggest problem is the fact that they take you completely out of Federation space and the things you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve come to love as a fan of Star Trek. Everything that helped build the Trek experience for the most part was gone.</p>
<p>Second, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve never been a huge fan of Captain Janeway. Mainly her voice drove me to the point of wanting to shove a spoon up my own ass. But the character Tom Paris almost made up for it. Then there is Tuvok Jenkins. (I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m sure he&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a Jenkins boy) Unfortunately all Vulcans are like Spock. Making them black doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t add any level of depth to the character. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not the writer&acirc;&euro;&trade;s or the actor&acirc;&euro;&trade;s fault. You can only have so many emotionless characters before they all seem alike.</p>
<p>But I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m watching this marathon that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s on Spike TV. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve been a bit sidelined due to a deep abdominal pain. (Weird huh. Didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know I had abdominal muscles left) I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve got to admit that the marathon is making me curious again about the show. I might even go as far as to buy a season or if I find a good deal on Ebay, possibly the entire series.</p>
<p>I think I might have just caught a few bad episodes. Like the one where they meet DaVinci. ::shivers::&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; Could be worse I guess.</p>
