It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s called   Descent:Journey into the Dark. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s basically  what I would consider D&D the board game. Unlike most fantasy-based board games I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve  played, this one is actually co-operative.</p></p>

<p align="left">The object of the game, like any good D&D game is to clear the dungeon and get tons of booty. (Treasure for you non-pirate speaking folk) Through the dungeon you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll encounter different monsters, traps, treasures etc. One player serves as the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;DM&acirc;&euro; sort of speak and controls all of the enemy monsters as well all of the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;events&acirc;&euro; that occur during the game. All remaining players each receive a character card, which represents the hero they&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll be playing. You begin the game with 300 gold and can purchase basic equipment and potions with that gold. You earn gold through encounters and can go back to town to purchase more potions.</p></p>

<p align="left">The thing I like about the game is the teamwork aspect. As a team you can decide what order everyone is going to move in, so it affords you the opportunity to really come up with some strategies. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Jeff you go first, cause if you kill the monster that will open the doorway for me to hit the monster in the back&acirc;&euro;. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s really cool. Like many of the other games we have (Runebound, Axis & Allies, Betrayal at House on the Hill) it seems like a rather long game. Like needing an entire afternoon long. But it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s fun. Especially when you have cheesecake filling.</p></p>

<p align="left">Ah yes, this little delicious invention. Now you can get the cheesecake filling, without the actual cheesecake! A perfect dipping sensation. Yes&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;we are gluttonous. But you know you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re thinking&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;..&acirc;&euro;I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m a tad jealous&acirc;&euro;. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s ok, you should be. I suggest you go out and buy a tub of this stuff along with some ginger snaps for your delicious dipping extravaganza!</p></p>
