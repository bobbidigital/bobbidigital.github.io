<p>There's a lot of buzz on the Internet about the leaking of the Wolverine film on the Internet. Even more so, there's a lot of talk about the movie being a turd on 35mm. But let's take into account that the leaked copy is unfinished, with the special effects being either incomplete or non-existent. The Wolverine Origins story was in no way going to mesmerize you with its story and plot. This will be a summer popcorn flick as you watch the pretty colors and explosions.</p>
<p>With that being said, I'm avoiding the leaked film like herpes. I'm not saying that I'm ignoring the fact the film is probably going to be a train wreck, but I think we at least owe it to the creative team to view it in the manner in which they intended it to be seen. This however won't excuse them from a few special things I need in order to give any form of objective criticism. </p>
<p>I know this won't happen and I'm being hopeful, but quite honestly I'm still a little sour about the way they killed my boy Cyclops in the X3 movie. I'm not a huge Cyclops fan, but I appreciate his character, what he's done for the X-men, and what he stands for as a comic book character. He deserves more than an off-camera death. I'd like to see his teammates display some type of real emotion or appreciation for the fact the Cyclops is missing. I sat through the end of the credits to see the real deal with Cyclops. After the scene with Patrick Stewart, I waited patiently until the lights in the theater finally came on. I was sitting in my carnage of popcorn and Raisinets wondering what the hell just happened. So the bottom line is, I want an explanation from the director of Wolverine.</p>
<p>I know the director isn't the same as X3, but being part of the Marvel franchise he must have the sins of the father visited upon him. I want at least 7 minutes of footage explaining what happened to Cyclops after that fateful scene. Then I want to see the director and producer of X3 apologize to James Marsden on camera, and then to apologize to us as fans. After that, they could honestly do whatever the fuck they want with the Wolverine film and I'll still be satisfied.</p>
<p>It would also be nice to know why Cyclops doesn't recognize Wolverine in the original X-Men movie. Cyclops is clearly in the film, based on the credits and the trailer. I hope it doesn't involve time travel or some sort of memory wipe. I'm a little filled to the brim with both.</p>
