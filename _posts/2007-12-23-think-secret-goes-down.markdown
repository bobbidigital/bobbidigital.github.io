<a href="http://blog.wired.com/business/2007/12/apple-and-think.html">Apple Kills Think Secret: Publisher Nick Ciarelli Talks</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The three-year court battle between popular rumor site Think Secret and Apple has concluded. Sadly, the end result is that Think Secret will no longer be published.</p>
<p>Speaking by phone Wednesday morning Nick Ciarelli, Think Secret's publisher, refused to say whether he was angry or not that Apple is forcing him to shut down his website. All he would say is that he was "very satisfied" with the settlement.</p>
<p>"It's great," he said, "it's great to put this behind us. It's great that we got a settlement that satisfies both parties." It's possible the settlement may prevent him from reporting on Apple ever again, although Ciarelli, 22, wouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t specify whether this was true.</p>
<p>For a time, Think Secret was one of the most successful of half-a-dozen Apple rumor sites. The site reported a string of high-profile scoops, consistently revealing details of Apple's product plans all through the mid-2000s. But the site also got many things wrong, and missed several important products.</p>
<p>Apple brought a civil lawsuit after Think Secret published details of an unreleased music product codenamed "Asteroid" in January 2005. Specifically, the company went after Think Secret for "posting Apple trade secrets and encouraging and inducing persons to provide product information in breach of agreements," the lawsuit said. </blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>Think Secret, which launched in 1999, tried to have the lawsuit dismissed, calling it "an affront to the First Amendment, and an attempt to use Apple's economic power to intimidate small journalists...." The case, and a similar lawsuit against Apple Insider and PowerPage.org, attracted the legal assistance from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, and became a cause c&Atilde;&copy;l&Atilde;&uml;bre amongst journalists.</p>
<p>Even while the Apple lawsuit was active, Think Secret continued to post news and software screenshots, in spite of threatening legal letters from Apple. Ciarelli says he actually has a stack of cease-and-desist letter, although they are not framed.</blockquote></p>
