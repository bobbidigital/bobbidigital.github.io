  content: "\"Guess what, you'll always be behind - because Mac is a state of mind
    ...\"\r\n\r\nWow, 2 spinning pizzas at once, that's almost too much!\r\n\r\nThe
    quote's right, though. I once worked with an engineer who used to be a top go-kart
    racer (amazingly, those things went about 150mph, I think). He told me everyone
    always wanted to look at his kart design.\r\n\r\nHe said he let them look all
    they wanted, because he knew if they copied his kart design, he'd still beat them
    next year with a better one.\r\n\r\nSo what is that, about 5 OS X releases since
    Longhorn/Vista was announced?"
