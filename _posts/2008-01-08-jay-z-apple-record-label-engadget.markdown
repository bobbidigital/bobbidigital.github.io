<p>Maybe Engadget knows something I don't, but isn't this a really old rumor? Didn't we hear about this years ago? And the consensus was Apple would never get into PRODUCING music simply because if it's contractual obligations in the settlement with The Beatles? I thought the settlment was "You guys can stay Apple, as long as you don't produce music".</p>
<p>Could this be resurfacing because of Jay-Z's step-down from Def Jam? Or did I miss a press release?</p>
