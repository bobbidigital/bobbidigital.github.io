<p><a href="http://www.thelittleappfactory.com"><img src ="http://www.allthingsdork.com/images/netflixfreak.jpg" align="left" height="95" width="97"></a>I've talked on this blog before about my dislike for some web applications. For me it's really the snappiest of the interface combined with the wasted bandwidth in downloading extraneous information that isn't immediately needed for the task at hand.</p>
<p>Enter Netflix freak. Next to Gmail, Netflix is by far the website that I do the most work in on a regular basis. I'm constantly adding and tweaking my Netflix Queue as well as looking for films for my lady. Netflix Freak takes the experience from the browser into a nice little application with a scaled down interface.  Netflix Freak allows you to manage your queue without going on to the Netflix website. You can search titles, browse your history,</p>
<p>While the app does lack some of the social aspects of the site such as recommendations and movie notes, it's still a quick and dirty solution to your queue without hitting the website. The application is a mere $15 dollars and The Little App Factory offers a free 30 day trial offer.</p>
<p>And just as I'm writing this review, I see that a new version of the application is now available. So we'll see how that looks. Either way, I recommend at least checking it out.</p>
<p>Download it at <a href="http://www.thelittleappfactory.com">The Little App Factory</a></p>
