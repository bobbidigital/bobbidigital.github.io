  content: "Great suggestions, great Post!\r\n\r\nI actually just bumped my Netflix
    account to the 1 at a time plan. That's a movie every 3 days if you turn them
    around.\r\n\r\nYou mention the library, which of course is a terrific place for
    books, but at least here in Colorado, our libraries have movies, and audiobooks
    too. Not to mention e-books and digital audiobooks. Check out your librarie's
    web site.\r\n\r\nWe geeks have to save up our money for hardware. :-)"

<p>With the economy going in the shitter many of us are trying to save on cash in anyway possible. Usually the first thing to go is the entertainment budget. Sitting inside watching re-runs of Gunsmoke isn't going to make you feel too great during the winter time. So I'm coming up with the dork's guide to an economic downturn. Ways to stay entertained while still conserving on capital.</p>

<p>1. If you're a gamer, rent your games. Gears of War 2 is coming out on November 7th. Guess what? You could spend the entire day Saturday playing it. Play for half a day Sunday and you've probably beaten the game. Now you can enjoy this experience for $59.99 or you can enjoy it for $5.99.</p>
<p>2. Get efficient with your Netflix queue. If you've got the 3 movie plan or higher, there is no reason why you can't watch a new movie every day via Netflix. If you watch 2 movies or 200 movies it's still $19.99. It's a great family option as well. You might even turn it into a regular ritual. Who knows, you might even start to like your children again! And let's not forget the Instant View queue.</p>
<p>3. Find a way to hook your PC/Mac up to your television. Why? Because there are so many more FREE viewing options on the Internet. Got kids? School them on some old school Transformers cartoons from Joost. Starscream is mad bitch.</p>
<p>4. Cultivate your Twitter and Facebook friends. Time to plan some wine and cheese parties. You make a small dish or buy some cheese. Invite people over and have everyone bring a bottle of wine. Throw in some board games and you've got a night full of fun. Also a good way to meet new people.</p>
<p>5. Join Meetup.com. There are tons of groups out there doing free and cheap activities. Monitor them and hop in when applicable.</p>
<p>6. Remember the ancient fun task known as "reading". A lot of people forgot that there are these really cool places called "Libraries" where you can get all the latest titles you've been dying to read for free. So stop going broke on Amazon and start tapping this resource. A lot of libraries have movies and graphic novels as well.</p>
<p>7. Split your comic book pull list with people. Chances are you and your friends pick up the exact same comics week after week. Time to arrange a book swap. Select the titles you both actively read and split them. Read your stack and swap. It's a lot better than being too broke to grab ANY of your comics. Your comic book store will appreciate you too.</p>
<p>OK so I could come up with 7 items. But as I think of more I'll throw them up. As dorks and geeks I think we have access to forms of entertainment that are low to no cost, activities a lot of people are not even aware of.&Acirc;&nbsp; Each of us is connected to hundreds in our immediate network&Acirc;&nbsp; who are facing the same challenges we are.&Acirc;&nbsp; Now is a great time to take advantage of it!<span> </span></p>
