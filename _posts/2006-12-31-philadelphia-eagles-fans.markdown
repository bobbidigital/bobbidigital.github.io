<p>I've heard of the city of brotherly love and their horrible fans. I realize that Vet stadium had to have a judge underneath the stands so that they could expedite the judicial process. But what about Philly makes the asses-to-humans ratio so high? Check out this exchange I received (from a total stranger) on MySpace via their e-mail system.</p>
<p><a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=105294274">Blue</a>:  You back-woods southerners are all alike: know nothing, daddy guessing,  What do we yanks gotta do &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; come down there every 140 years or so to kick your confederate asses, burn & pillage your towns and don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t stop &acirc;&euro;&tilde;till Atlanta is smoldering again?  We better not do that or you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll have another reason to not work for the next century or two. Yeah,  Just stay an inch or two outta kicking distance.</p>
<p>Me: Umm.. do I know you? Or do you just randomly mail insults?</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=105294274">Blue</a>: no, I purposely picked falcon fans,to purposely hurl insults at,and no you don't know me, I don't like your kind,I like packer fans,Denver fans with vagina's,and three Pittsburgh fans,but certainly not falcon fans,don't be absurd!,the very thought is laughable .</p>
<p>WTF?</p>
