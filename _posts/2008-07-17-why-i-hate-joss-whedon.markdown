  content: "Dude... I watched Buffy from episode 1 when they aired. I then bought
    all 7 seasons and I am currently picking up season 8 comics when they are bundled...
    own Firefly/Serenity too.\r\n\r\nDr Horrible is pretty funny.\r\n\r\nProbably
    the geekiest thing of it all is that I am now linked to Felicia Day http://feliciaday.com
    because I am her \"IM buddy\" on all things website-related, as she's mentioned
    in recent interviews.\r\n\r\nAside http://drhorrible.com, her own award-winning
    internet project The Guild http://watchtheguild.com will begin filming
    its second season next month. She is very web 2.0/social media.\r\n\r\nI think
    I just became a publicist... wtf!?!?!? :)"

    hasn't she? I don't know much about her. I'll check out the website fo'shizzle.

  content: "Kripes, here I am, scouring the internet looking for at least ONE OTHER
    PERSON who shares my hatred for Joss Whedon.  And I found a series of links including
    the phrase \"I Hate Joss Whedon\".  This is the third one I clicked, and so far,
    the authors of these supposedly anti-Whedon articles are actually rabid fan-zombies
    of this douche bag.\r\n\r\nIt leaves a vision of a few million people bowing before
    a giant elephant turd."

<p>I remember the first time I saw Firefly. I was at Shawn's apartment, 4 of my friends sitting in front of the television completely in awe with what they described as "a science fiction orgasm".</p>
<p>I thought the show was really fucking dumb.</p>
<p>But friends don't let friends miss out on good science fiction. They convinced me to take the series home and view them in order. A day later I was wearing a shirt that read "Joss Whedon is My Master Now." I became enthralled with the worlds and characters that Whedon had created. The dialogue was so sharp and witty. I felt ashamed for not having supported the show when it was on FOX. I used this as a jumping off point into other Whedon works. Despite how much of a sissy it makes me look like, I started watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I remember the looks I would get from women (non-dork women) when I told them I was watching Buffy on DVD. It was the first time I was even a little embarrassed about my dorkiness. Well Whedon has done it again.</p>
<p>Joss Whedon had the horrible idea of making a musical. But not just any musical, but a musical about a (not entirely) evil low budget villain named Dr. Horrible, who is hell bent on ruling the world. We watch Dr. Horrible chase after his laundry love, battle his arch nemesis Captain Hammer and struggle to prove his worthiness for the "Thorough Bred of Sin". All of this done to the sounds of some catchy show tunes. I won't go into too much detail other than saying that this project succeeds, even though I'm ashamed to say it.</p>
<p>Starring Neil Patrick Harris (Starship Troopers and some silly kid doctor show), Nathan Fillion and Felicia Day, the 3 act musical will have you giggling even though deep down you're trying to tell yourself how dumb this is. You just can't help but enjoy it. Joss Whedon continues to turn corny, silly and utterly stupid ideas into a collection of fun memorable moments and characters. </p>
<p>Joss I don't know how you do it, but I applaud you. Even though you make me ashamed of myself sometimes, I can't help but admire your talents.</p>
