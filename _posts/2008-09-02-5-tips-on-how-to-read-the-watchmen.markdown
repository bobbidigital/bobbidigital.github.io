<p><a href="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/watchmen.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-443" style="margin: 3px; border: 3px solid black;" title="watchmen" src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/watchmen-193x300.jpg" alt="" width="193" height="300" /></a>With the launch of the&Acirc;&nbsp;<em>Watchmen</em> film looming nearby, there is no doubt that many people not familiar with Alan Moore's work will begin flocking to their local book stores in a rabid attempt to read the graphic novel prior to the film's theatrical release.&Acirc;&nbsp; This is a good thing and I applaud you all for doing it.&Acirc;&nbsp; But I hope you read this post before you crack open the pages, of what some consider to be, Moore's best work.</p>
<p>The Watchmen, as with most of Alan's work, is no mere comic book. For readers of titles like <em>The Hulk</em>, <em>Spiderman</em>, <em>Batman </em>or any other big name superhero from Marvel or DC, I urge you to approach this title differently. Alan Moore is a master of literary fiction and he takes the comic book genre to a whole new level. Here are a few tips about how you should be going about reading <em>Watchmen</em> to get the best experience possible out of it.</p>
<p>1. Be alert when you read -</p>
<p>This may sound like a silly stupid rule but it's a very important one. Many of us who read comics know that we're not expecting too much of a brain tease when we go into. Wolverine is going to go in, talk some trash and stab someone in the face with his claws. So reading Wolverine before bedtime or while on the porcelain throne is perfectly acceptable. But Moore's stories are more elaborate and involved. They operate on different levels using metaphors, historical quotes and other literary references.</p>
<p>2. Examine each panel -</p>
<p>Alan Moore is known for the meticicoulous amount of detail he provides his artists. With that in mind, I would recommend making sure you look at everything in the panel.&Acirc;&nbsp; From the bum sitting on the stool&Acirc;&nbsp; to the costume of The Comedian on the floor.&Acirc;&nbsp; Pay attention to everything.</p>
<p>3. These are superheroes but they're not super human</p>
<p>This book isn't filled with super powered mutants or anything like that.&Acirc;&nbsp; (Save for Dr. Manhattan) This is a very human story with a bunch of dusty ass HUMANS.&Acirc;&nbsp; No laser blasts from the eyes or no shit like that. You've been warned.</p>
<p>4.&Acirc;&nbsp; Remember the Time Frame</p>
<p>Remember when this book was written. Released in seperate issues (12 in all) during the later part of the Cold War. The perspective, ideas and themes from that book are a direct reflection of what was going on in that era. Thanks to President Bush (without giving any spoilers out) some of the story elements remain incredibly relevant. But other ideas and themes may not have aged as well and won't seem pertinent to readers who don't take history into account.</p>
<p>5. Read It Twice</p>
<p>Sounds funny I know, but this is one of those books that you have to read a second time. Kind of like watching The Prestige for the second time when you know the whole story and can see the seeds of the story being put down.</p>
<p>So these 5 quick tips will probably help your Watchmen reading experience that much better and get you ready for the movie. Whenever it comes out.</p>
