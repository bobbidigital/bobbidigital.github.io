<p>For those of us who are still using DirecTV, you can now rejoice. A DirecTV application to record your shows via your DVR has finally arrived. The application is called (aptly) DirecTV and sports a very straightforward interface.</p>
<p>You can find television shows via search by channel or by date and time. The nice thing is that in the Settings panel you can set it to only display channels that you subscribe to. (Very helpful) The interface feels like a solid iPhone app, which based on my previous experience with DirecTV is more of a credit to the Apple SDK than to the DirecTV developers.</p>
<p>Once you find a show, you can set it to record the episode or record the entire series. You can also select which DVR should record it (if you own multiple), give the recording a priority of "Record if Possible" or "Definitely Record". This works in tandem with the Prioritizer feature in the DVR, which helps dictate what shows get recorded in the event of a recording conflict. You can also set the "Keep Until" option to "Disk is Full" or "I Delete It".</p>
<p>Will you handle all your recordings with this application? My guess is you probably not, but if you're on the go and forgot about that episode of Grey's Anatomy than you'll be happy that you have it.</p>
<p>The application is free and works over EDGE/3G and Wifi. The application was fairly snappy for me on EDGE as well, so even though I don't own a 3G phone I'm sure the performance will be solid.</p>
