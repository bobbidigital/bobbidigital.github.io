<p>OK so I'm taking the plunge and checking out more of these Web 2.0 apps. Some are great and some make me wonder what the point is. My latest endevour today is Twitter.</p>
<p>I guess Twitter has been around for a little while, but basically it's a web based app which serves essentially as a glorified away message. You post updates as to what you're doing at the moment for the world to see. Part of me wonders if anyone actually cares what I'm doing. I imagine this could be great for family members who are spread out and want to stay in touch. Or for online friends/lovers to keep tabs on one another. I'm thinking right now Stephanie would probably love to be able to login and check on what I'm doing. I guess that's enough.</p>
<p>So I'm on there, trying to figure out what everyone is going crazy about. I guess it's different for me because most of my friends aren't super geeks like me. We'll see.</p>
