<p>Sorry this post is so late. Lots of crazy things happening. In this episode we take our podcast mobile again at the Chicago Comic Book Meetup.</p>
<p>Again apologize for the lateness. Check out Betsy, a fun guest we had on the show on Twitter as Eris404.</p>
<p>Tell us which super power you would like. Both cool and crappy!</p>
