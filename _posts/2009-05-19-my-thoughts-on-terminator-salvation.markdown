  content: "When the wife I got back from Jamaica yesterday, we watched Terminator.
    Then we watched T2: Judgment Day today.\r\n\r\nJudgment Day definitely showed
    some delving into deeper themes amongst all the action. I especially enjoyed the
    moments that started to get onto a soap box (when Sara Connor goes off on how
    horrible men are to Dyson), then other characters knocked them off it because
    it was too intense and didn't help them reach their goals.\r\n\r\nThen again,
    T2 could definitely be considered an exception to the Terminator franchise.\r\n\r\nI
    haven't seen Salvation yet, but there's a small little voice inside that complains
    about movies getting made beyond T2.  It definitely feels like Cameron concluded
    the story well enough.\r\n\r\nThen again, I have this reaction after seeing the
    non-theatrical ending that is an easter egg on one of the T2 DVD releases.  Nonetheless,
    in some theories of time travel, the existence of John Connor does necessitate
    the future existence of Skynet and the War.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes down to it, though,
    if it's an entertaining movie, it's an entertaining movie. It's easy enough to
    accept that the different stories exist in different time lines or to accept the
    plot contrivances without good explanation."

With those memories fresh in my mind there was probably more than a bit of trepidation in wait of McG's attempt to leave his mark on the series.</p>
<p>The Chicago Nerd Social Club was invited to a press/promotional screening of the film on Monday so I got a sneak peak at the film. All in all I'd say it was a fun film with peaks and valleys throughout. The arrangements of those peaks and valleys were probably my biggest problem, as the pacing of the film seemed to be off.</p>
<p>The film opens with Sam Worthington's character Marcus Wright, who is on death row. He gets visited by a Doctor Serena Kogan, played by Helena Bonham Carter. The dialogue between them drags on entirely too long considering that it's set in the past and as a viewer you instantly know what story elements are trying to be established here. It honestly felt like the scene was designed simply for the opening credits sequence. This isn't the type of opener you come to expect from a Terminator film, or any action film at that, and quickly begins to bore you. But once the action sequences start you quickly realize why McG was chosen for this project.</p>
<p>Let's be honest. Terminator movies are about the action sequences and McG does an excellent job. The sequences are fun, terrifying and all posses that feeling of "how the hell are they getting out of this!" The art direction and character design is especially well done as we get a look at some different Terminator models as well as transport ships and a data hub of Skynet.</p>
<p>The plot is familiar to us, protecting our future by ensuring the past occurs unfettered by SkyNet intervention. But in an odd twist from the first film, we have an adult John Connor attempting to protect and save a young Kyle Reese. Don't spend anymore than 5 seconds trying to understand the temporal aspects of this, just enjoy the movie. The timeline places us right around the initial construction of the T-800 series, so the Terminators we see are the T-600 models which only have the skeletal structures and those menacing red eyes.</p>
<p>Fast forward from the original scene set in 2003, to the year 2018, presumably a few years after Judgement Day. Marcus Wright awakens in a complex housing humans who were captured by SkyNet. In a very <em>V for Vendetta</em> like scene, Marcus is awoken with no idea of what has happened in the past 15 years. He later runs into a young Kyle Reese and after a brief encounter with a T-600 we have some more awkward dialogue as Marcus tries to figure out where he is and what's going on in the world. Kyle listens to a broadcast from John Connor and feels compelled to find him. Let the action commence.</p>
<p>Some of the character motivations are a bit questionable as years of fighting an enemy seemingly get erased because we meet a "nice Terminator". War hardens people and it makes them more skeptical than the naturally would be. When characters behave this way they look less like people in a fictional world and more like a plot device.</p>
<p>Pacing and characterization issues aside, the film was a fun and welcome addition to the franchise. There are some nice moments for die hard Terminator fans and new fans will also feel at home, although they won't take away the same experience. (They never really go into <strong>WHY</strong> John Connor and Kyle Reese are so important, they assume you know.</p>
<p>On a side note, it's interesting how the paradoxes of time travel seem to not bother nerds who watch The Terminator series. Even though the story is entirely dependent on the mechanics of time travel, we as nerds don't berate it for its temporal mechanical faults. We accept it as it is and enjoy the show. </p>
<p>Star Trek on the other hand.....</p>
