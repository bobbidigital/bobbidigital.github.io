<p>I'm a huge Mac fan, just like Jeff. Since I started looking at purchasing a Mac a couple years ago I realized that I wasn't going to be able to cheap out on some stuff. They only use SATA drives, only have PCI-Express slots, Etc... I just thought, rather arrogantly, that that was the price to be payed for staying on the cutting edge. I also have a problem, I have too many peripherals. I must have a dozen damned devices that use the USB ports. This means I have cords snaking all over the place and I don't want to add another set of cords by having a USB hub, so I like to add USB port expansion cards. With my PC this wasn't a problem, I could go to the local Comp USA, pick up a card and be going in no time. Now, does anyone how many stores carry PCI Express cards? None. Not the Mac Store, not Comp Usa, not any of the big box stores. I have to mail order it, or just keep swapping out cords from the back of my Mac every time I want to use something. Sometimes there's a price to pay, mine is in ulcers! </p>
