<p>Another week, another wednesday, another pull list. Nothing unusual on the list today. I've also started reading <em>The Walking Dead</em> and let me tell you, it's awesome. I feel totally retarded for letting it go for so long without picking it up. Although in all honesty I enjoy the trades so that I can just sit down and overdose on the undead. Now I've got a SERIOUS hankering to play Left 4 Dead.</p>
