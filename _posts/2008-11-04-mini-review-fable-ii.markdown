  Fable II isn't an MMO it does have that type of world that seems to buzz to life
  around you. Part of this is due to your interaction with the inhabitants of the
  world of Albion. The townsfolk react to you in different ways based on your standing.
  Right now I can't seem to go through town without being chased by scores of women
  (and men) hoping to speak with me. Children run the streets begging for autographs.
  I also receive a substantial discount at most stores in town just for being me!
  It adds a level of realism without the irate ramblings of children who don't know
  how to behave on the Internet. Other open ended RPG's, such as Elder Scrolls IV,
  are quite expansive, but leave you with a feeling of loneliness. This is not the
  case in Fable II. You feel alive and connected with the world. When you're in a
  pinch, craving human interaction, hop on XBOX Live to try out the multiplayer capabilities.
  Even after the main story line ends, there are still plenty of things to do in Albion
  to keep you busy.\r\n\r\n"

<p>The game is quite fun, but in a lot of ways its too much like real life. For gamers like me, who just want to do everything in the purest of goals, it can almost be a bit stressful. For example, it's not like other RPG's where there are just scores of gold laying around everywhere. The best way by far it seems to earn money is to take a job blacksmithing. The job isn't fun and I'd rather be killing bandits, but it brings in a good amount of cash for a fairly easy thing to do. (Sounds like my life) I work so that I can keep my wife happy. (Yes you can marry and even have children) So now life becomes a balancing act between, work, play and keeping the lady happy. (The wife makes demands such as sex, nicer house, more affection etc) Now in the middle of all that you also are going along the main quest. It can be a lot to juggle. I spent 30 minutes real time just making swords so that I can buy my wife a nicer house. It was the one sore spot in our relationship but no longer! Now I'm looking for a special gift for my daughter to keep her happy with me. See what I mean? Lots of real life tasks.</p>
<p>I do love the games progressiveness in some areas. The world of Albion is already far ahead of most of our states here in America. How? They allow gay marriage. Yes there are characters out there who are gay and if you are charismatic enough to woo them you can even get married. I'm not sure if you can have children through adoption or not. I haven't actually attempted to marry a man yet. But it's these little options that make the game seem so immersive and real.</p>
<p>The game could be seen as inappropriate for some ages though. Despite the "M for Mature" rating, a parent might pick up the game, scan it over real quick and notice that there are no demons involved and no prostitution and give it a go. But there are quite a few mature decisions to be made and some very horrific actions that can be performed. The forums actually have a guy who killed his wife in front of his children and then moved the new wife into the home. The choice between using condoms and going "raw" is present with the latter choice often resulting in children, but not always. Other purely evil deeds are propositioned to you. I would say the game could be use to find out if you're child is a psycho or not. If he does all the evil things in the game with delight, check your Internet logs. He's probably an asshole there too.</p>
<p>Despite a few collision detection glitches and a handful of bone-headed interface design choices, I'm really enjoying the game a lot. Because I'm doing everything in the purest of fashions , the game will offer tons of replay options as I can go back and play from the evil angle, which I'm sure is devilish fun. I originally bought the game as a hold over until Gears of War 2 came out, but this is an excellent game nonetheless that should play second fiddle to no one.</p>
<p>If you haven't gotten it already, go out and buy it. It's well worth the wait.</p>
