<blockquote>Ahoy, squirts! Quint here. We've been hearing word of a SHORT CIRCUIT remake for a little while now, but it seems that Bob Weinstein is now making the flick at Dimension.</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm not even sure how to go about responding to this news. Now don't get me wrong, I loved me some original Short Circuit. But somethings should be left dead. I could only imagine what 21st century Hollywood would do to a personal classic. Next thing you know they'll be remaking classics TV shows like Dukes of Hazzard or Starsky and Hutch.</p>
