<p><img src="images/wefeelfine.gif" height="100" width="150" class="right" border="2">Ok..so I'm pretty sure if you have a pulse and have been on the Internet then you need to check out this site. <a href="http://www.wefeelfine.org">We Feel Fine</a>. The project indexes blogs with the statements "I Feel <blank>" </p>
<p>The point of it is to try and figure out how we're feeling as an Internet society. It's way too much to try and explain, I suggest you go check the site out. There are tons of different styles to view the data as well as links to the blogs in which the data was found. Truly awesome idea. Don't be a herb, check it out.</p>
