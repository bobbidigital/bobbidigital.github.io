<p>If you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re not reading &acirc;&euro;&oelig;The Boys&acirc;&euro; my first question to you is why the hell not?</p>
<p>This book is awesome. While at first I was a bit turned off by the extremely graphic nature of the book (this is NOT for kids NOT NOT NOT) I thought I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d stick with it because I liked the essence of the story. I guess I should tell you about that.</p>
<p>The Boys are a group of CIA authorized operatives who are charged with keeping the superheroes of the world in check. The premise takes us in a world where the super humans are still just human in the character aspect of things. They make mistakes; they have dark secrets and their susceptible to things like, vanity, money and jealousy.  So imagine how mentally tweaked a REAL teenager would be if he all of a sudden got super powers.  The Boys takes us down that dark road.</p>
<p>So the book goes through some seriously exaggerated situations to pit us against the heroes. They&acirc;&euro;&trade;re heroes, but they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re assholes.  One panel even has a new super hero team member being forced to perform sexual favors to make the team. Yeah.not for kids. In come The Boys. They don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t buy into the public media hype and they kick ass and take names to uncover the darker side of the hero&acirc;&euro;&trade;s lives and make sure they walk the straight and narrow.</p>
<p>This book has some GORGEOUS artwork as well as some hilarious storylines.  One of the main characters was actually inspired and has an incredible resemblance to Simon Pegg of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Shawn of the Dead&acirc;&euro; fame. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s currently on issue 11 I think but you can easily find issues 1- 6 in trade paperback and the others as singles.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and read this book. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s fun and as real as a super hero comic book could be. They also have a bit starting in issue 7 making fun of my beloved Batman with the character &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Tek Knight&acirc;&euro;. Yeah..It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s some cold stuff.</p>
