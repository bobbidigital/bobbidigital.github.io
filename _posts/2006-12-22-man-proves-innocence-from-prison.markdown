<p class="MsoNormal">I know this isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t really dork news, but I thought the story was very compelling. A man spends 16 years of his life in jail for a crime he didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t commit. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the type of theft can never be repaid. Could you imagine losing 16 years and all you get is: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Our bad. We&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll try to get you out as soon as we can.&acirc;&euro;¬ù</p></p>
