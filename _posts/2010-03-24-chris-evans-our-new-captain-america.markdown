<p>I've been a bit dormant as of late thanks to my recent nuptials. After our wedding ceremony and our great honeymoon I was pleased to come home and learn that our beloved Marvel superhero Captain America had been cast. Of course I was expecting the casting to be something sensible, but I guess I was asking too much from the boys and girls at Marvel Studios.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/images/ChrisEvans.jpg" style="height:25%; float:left; margin:5px 5px 5px 5px;">Before I get started, I want to point a few things out. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0262635/">Chris Evans</a> is not a bad actor by any means. In fact I think this kid has a bit of depth and range that has yet to be explored. Some of this talent became evident to me when I watched Sunshine. (Arguably one of my favorite films) It showed me that the guy can adapt to the role and doesn't always have to play the comedic, snarky roles that he's typically been cast in. Chris, my issue is not with you.</p>
<p>Originally, Marvel Studios stated that they wanted an unknown to play Captain America, which I can understand and respect. Unless you have the perfect casting, it's sometimes difficult for people to get their mind wrapped around a big name star donning the mantle of one of their beloved heroes.</p>
<p>But somewhere down the line Marvel reversed this position and not only started considering name actors like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1475594/">Channing Tatum</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1024677/">John Krasinski</a>, but wound up casting someone who had already starred in a Marvel movie! </p>
<p>How did we get here? Even though the Fantastic Four films were not received well by a large portion of the viewing audience, it wasn't that long ago that Chris Evans was on fire, saving NYC from the nefarious schemes of Doctor Doom. I actually enjoyed the films for their tongue and cheek humor, but regardless of your opinion I think we can agree that Chris Evans played a pretty damn good Human Torch. But that doesn't guarantee him success with Captain America. My top 3 reasons are:</p>
<ol>
<li> He's Young</li><br />
	That may sound silly, but think about it. Captain America is a leader of men. Not just men, but super powered men. He's the <strong>KING</strong> alpha dog. It will take an incredible amount of script writing for me to believe that this young lad can earn the respect of the folks around him. That's more a task for the writers than for Evans. If the script is there, he'll deliver the goods.</p>
<li>The Avengers Movie</li><br />
	We're not just signing on for the Captain America movies. We're also signing on for an Avengers film. This kind of ties into my first point. The Avengers will be composed of Robert Downey Jr, Edward Norton, Samuel L. Jackson, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1165110/">Chris Hemsworth</a> as Thor and a few yet to be cast folks. Aside from Hemsworth, all of these actors are <strong>considerably</strong> older than Evans. Will we be able to buy that this guy is leading such a remarkable band of individuals?</p>
<li>Captain America is Blond</li><br />
	It sounds nit-picky and stupid but here me out. In my mind, Captain America being blond haired and blue eyed is a major piece of the character. Think about the time frame when Captain America was active. It was during World War II and Captain America was a spitting image of what Hitler was trying to achieve, the perfect Aryan. This isn't mere window dressing for the character, but is really a piece of the characters history. If rumors are true and the Cap film will be done as a period piece, his heritage has even more weight to it. Let's hope a little hair dye will keep Chris's charm intact.<br />
</ol></p>
<p>No amount of complaining will change the decisions made. It also won't alter the fact that I'm going to see this movie the day it's released. I just hope that the script is given a top notch treatment, which will allow Evans to really shine. I'd hate to see another super hero franchise go down in flames (bad pun) with Evans at the helm. If it does tank, I'd be very surprised if Evans is at fault.</p>
<p>If they had gotten the ball rolling a little bit earlier, you'll see my picks for Captain America below. If Bruce Willis can still do Die Hard films, these guys should have been given a call.</p>
