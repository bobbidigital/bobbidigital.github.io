  in my household lately about the viability of the iPhone as the greatest cell phone
  platform ever created. The argument is typically started by half-wanted house guests
  who work for cell phone companies, but I digress. I know the iPhone doesn't do video.
  It doesn't do copy and paste. It doesn't do MMS. It doesn't do turn by turn GPS.
  It doesn't have a secret container for hoagies in case you get hungry later. The
  arguments have centered around what the phone doesn't do and why would I want something
  so feeble. Well I'm going to take you through a normal day with my iPhone and show
  you why I think it's the single device that I can't live without.\r\n\r\n"

<p>I wake up in the to the sound of annoying alarm courtesy of my iPhone. Granted, it could be louder but it's still loud enough for me to wake up from it. I disconnect it from the laptop plug in my headphones and begin listening to either a podcast, an audio book or if I feel like jamming out I'll throw on some music.</p>
<p>Now the nice thing about the music is that I have options. I'll either listen to some of my play lists or I'll fire up the <a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.FM </a>application for the iPhone or maybe even <a href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora</a> to give me some new music. (Connected to my home WiFi network so I don't have to stream over EDGE) I iron my clothes listening to whatever I've selected. Perfect. Once my clothes are done, I hop in the shower (without the iPhone) get cleaned up and get ready to head out.</p>
<p>Once dressed I throw on my headphones again as I bag a lunch or pack my bag. I might check the weather in the colder months to get an idea on what I should be wearing. I than click on my "Bus Stop Work" bookmark to get an idea of how long before my chariot to the office arrives. Five minutes? I better hustle! 15 minutes? I can stroll and take my time. While I'm walking to the bus stop I might make a quick phone call back home or call the boss and let him know if I'm running late.</p>
<p>Now I'm on the bus and I'm going to catch up on my news. I fire up the AP News application and get my fill of news right on my phone. I laugh at the guy in front of me who's trying to wrestle his newspaper into a shape that is both readable and not hitting other passengers in the back of the head. Time to switch to my train now. My train goes underground so unfortunately there's no cell phone service, AP News won't function for too long. No worries because I'm also reading <em>Anansi Boys</em> on my iPhone. I fire up my eReader application and there it is, black background and white text so it's a little easier on the eyes. I read my book until I get to my last stop.</p>
<p>On my way to the office I'll make a quick Twitter Post with Twinkle, or I'll check into <a href="http://www.brightkite.com">Bright Kite</a> using text messaging. My iPhone is also hooked up to the office exchange server, so I'll check my e-mail really quick to make sure I"m not walking into a fire storm. Everything is safe. Good deal.</p>
<p>While I'm at work I'll watch some video casts, listen to some podcasts and just enjoy some music. On my lunch break if nothing is going on I'll eat in the cafeteria and either read some more or play a game. Maybe some Poker or Super Monkey Ball. After work I get a text message from a friend asking me to meet them out somewhere. I don't recognize the street name so I launch Google Maps and get directions to the place. Even without GPS (remember, I'm on a 2G iPhone) the cell tower triangulation method works somewhat reliably given I'm not smack in the middle of downtown. I decide to grab a cab. While I'm in the back I fire up Sports Tap or MLB At Bat and get an update on my Cubs. They're losing which is kind of a bummer. Another couple of quick twitter updates as well as responding to some e-mail while I'm in the cab. I remember about a topic I want to blog about later and I drop it into OmniFocus on the iPhone, my mobile "to-do" management system.</p>
<p>So I get to the bar and it's jam packed. Not really our scene either, but a few friends had heard about it. We decide to switch places but don't know where to go. I know that there is a cool application called iWant that will tell me where things are in the area, but I don't have it. I connect to the App Store and download it in a couple of minutes. iWant tells us there are 4 bars nearby that we've heard some good things about. We're off.</p>
<p>Few drinks later we're ready to head back to the house, maybe play some video games. It's pay day so why not buy a new game we can all play. But what's good? Well I'll check really quick with my IGN Reviews application. Couple of good options with some good reviews, lets go get one!</p>
<p>We buy the game head back to the house and the power is out. Turns out the breaker got tripped and nobody was home downstairs to turn it back on. The basement is dark, but luckily I have my iPhone flashlight application. I turn it on and use it to light my way. It's not the greatest but it surely gets the job done.</p>
<p>The rest of the night is spent playing video games, watching You Tube videos on the phone and controlling the Apple TV from the iPhone as well.</p>
<p>Now I'll admit that I do charge the phone during the day while I'm at the office. So when I leave the office it's typically at a full charge. But this is the type of usefulness I get out of the iPhone. Simply put, it's the one device that I need to get me through the day. You guys are probably calling this story bullshit. I call it "last Friday".</p>
