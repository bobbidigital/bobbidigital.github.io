  content: "Actually, I discovered that NBC and its subsidiaries went with Amazon
    for downloading TV shows. Some of them are much cheaper than iTunes.\r\n\r\nThis
    is something I've been wanting to do (ditch cable that is) and I think it's getting
    closer to being a reality."

<p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a Friday night and I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t really feel like going out. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve got 3 Netflix movies that I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve already watched and need to be returned. So I decide to turn on the old TV and begin to channel surf.</p>
<p>Now if you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re like me, chances are that when you do actually watch television, you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re either watching something you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve got on your DVR or you spend more time looking for content than you do actually watching it. </p>
<p>During what alcoholics refer to as &acirc;&euro;&oelig;a moment of clarity&acirc;&euro;, I realized that I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve been paying $50 dollars per month to enjoy the privilege of watching DVR. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve also realized that 90% of the things I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve recorded are on ABC, CBS, NBC or FOX, all channels that are free over the air. So with this thought in mind, I decided to begin a little experiment in ditching cable. I figure with all the Internet streaming video out there, it should be feasible right? Yes and no.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-389"></a><br />
The first thing I had to do was hook up my G5 tower to my television. I came to this decision thanks to NBC pulling most of their content from iTunes. Normally I would just purchase the TV shows I need. (I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m well aware I could probably pirate them, but I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m trying to do this legit) So with NBC and Sci-Fi not accessible, I realized that I need Hulu, which will require a browser. Hacking the Apple TV was also an option, but in the grand scheme just wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t worth the hassle.</p>
<p>Connecting my G5 to the television was cake. I simply used my ADC connector and went into the VGA port on my television. The picture quality is perfect and it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s formatted accurately from the computer. I originally tried the DVI interface but found that the picture wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t sharp and the aspect ratio was slightly off.  After that, a quick pairing with my bluetooth mouse and keyboard and I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m watching <a href="http://www.hulu.com">Hulu.com</a> videos on my television.</p>
<p>Hulu is nice in there selection of video. The only drawback is that if you haven&acirc;&euro;&trade;t been keeping up with a show, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s difficult to get caught up via Hulu. They typically only carry the last 5 - 8 episodes of a new show, sometimes less. For instance Battlestar Galactica has a single episode available. Doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t do me much good if I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve missed all of season 4.  With it not available via iTunes, my only other option to catch up is to Bit-Torrent. Sad that we have to resort to this. The most typical response would be &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Wait for the DVD!&acirc;&euro; People who are saying that are clearly not in tune with the fact that we live in an on-demand world these days.</p>
<p>So I spent some time watching episodes and movies on Hulu in full screen mode. (Yes Hulu has some movies now.) The video quality of Hulu, even full screen, is acceptable. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not great, but it doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t detract from what you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re watching by any means. Other streaming sites were also enjoyable on full screen. So far things are looking good. </p>
<p>The biggest problem I have at the moment is that services like Netflix streaming and Joost require an Intel-based mac. (Joost for the client, Netflix streaming for Parallels to run Internet Explorer) These two programs would further complete my available online content.</p>
<p>Up Next:</p>
<p>A post on the <a href="http://www.elgato.com/elgato/na/mainmenu/products/hybrid/product1.en.html">Eye-TV Hybrid</a> to get over the air HDTV signals to my mac. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.joost.com">Joost</a>: It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s actually pretty cool.</p>
