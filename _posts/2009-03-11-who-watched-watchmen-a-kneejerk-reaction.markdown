  content: A mini-series would have worked for me. Don't know about a triliogy. I
    don't think it would have fit quite right. I was OK with it. I'm not LOVING it,
    but it was good and it was a solid attempt by Zach. I refuse to pass final judgment
    on it until I see the director's cut.

  content: Same here. Once that ultimate cut comes out, I plan on taking the Friday
    off from work and indulging. However way you cut it, it was as solid effort. Now
    if only he would cut the slow-mos down. I mean damn!

March 2nd, 2009. 9:48 PM Cold out tonight. Flat soda in hand left over from film. Still unsure of what was seen. Hrrm. Must sleep on it.</p>
<p>20 plus years ago, I and many others purchased a comic that would one day become one of the most groundbreaking, creative collaborations of the 20th century. It crossed the line that separated super from plain, good from evil, and mortal from immortal. It blurred that black and white that eventually becomes gray when a little of the two intermingle and one color can't tell itself from the other. It questioned the beliefs one held with conviction. And all in a silly comic book!</p>
<p>After reading this hyper real dystopia with a poignant ending, my young mind filled with naivete-infused thought, like so many others, that a film adaptation would be an awesome idea. I could see it now. All framed and ready to go. The storyboards are there, just switch up some of the framing, instead of this angle, try this angle, on and on and on. Flash forward twenty-three years later. The film adaptation I imagined in my mind's theater wasn't on the screen. Those chills I felt go up my spine as I imagined certain shots never came. The ear to ear grin I expected to be wearing never appeared except maybe during a few moments that were compressed like a RAR archive on the highest compression possible. Where were the Watchmen?</p>
<p>Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons had the carte blanche to take old Charlton characters and re-envision them in whatever fashion they deemed fit. Straight off the successes of Swamp Thing and a Superman story that depicted a world without Superman amongst many other stories, Alan Moore took a huge leap of faith and decided to use the Charlton characters as a base to create new characters. His idea was to imagine a world where masked crusaders existed and to show how human they were compared to those they yearned to protect. The thin line between hero and villain became as obscured as Rorschach's blot mask in a dark alley. It was a mix of traditional superheroes with a dark secret, detective noir, sci-fi, and satire. It was never meant to be taken as seriously as it is portrayed today (making Time's 100 Books of the 20th Century is no small feat) yet the comic zeitgeist (or at least a majority of them) has embraced this limited comic series, along with The Dark Knight Returns, as the de facto of the graphic novel. </p>
<p>Terry Gilliam had been tapped to adapt Watchmen with a script by Sam Hamm (the EPITOME of a poor adaptation with David Hayter's and Alex Tse's running a close 2nd and 3rd) in the mid-to-late 80s and again in '96. Initially, he wanted to create a mini-series which would have been the best approach. The first time around he asked Alan Moore how he would approach it. His reply? </p>
<p>"I wouldn't."</p>
<p>I can dig where Alan was coming from. The 'movie' had already been 'made' but in a different medium. A medium that is limited by panels, words, and imagination where movie budgets are replaced with deadlines. However, I would be lying to say I wouldn't have wanted to see Dr. Manhattan disassemble a tank with a wave of his hand, create a crystal palace on Mars, or see Rorschach make small fry out of several criminals trying to cut his cell bars in an attempt to brutally slaughter him. Or to see if the Fearful Symmetry chapter would be played out marvelously with disconnected dialogue juxtaposed with images that tie into the next scene. And yes, a lot of this was captured by Snyder and Crew with great fanfare and substantial success but is this THE epitome of a (or deconstructive) superhero movie?</p>
<p> Like a Xerox copy reproduced over an infinite amount of time, this adaptation has lost something when it was transferred to the silver screen; its soul. As easily transferable as it may have seemed, there remains to be seen any beauty under all the grit, vitriol, and compound fractures. When reading the comics, you felt an attachment to the characters because they are closer to earth than an almost-indestructible alien from a far-away planet. But as close to earth as a comic character can be.</p>
<p>I have seen the film at least 3 times; March 2nd, at the IMAX midnight premiere, and Saturday. Why three times? Well, the first time, I was not happy at all. Not even a little bit. It was a kneejerk reaction. I didn't hate the ending but there were definitive moments where I wanted to pinch myself awake to realize this was just a nightmare. Or that this was just an audience test. But it wasn't. Those chills I wanted to get up my spine (like the ones I got from the trailer for J.J. Abrams' Star Trek. HOLY CRAP does it look phenom) just weren't there. The 2nd time I watched it, I began to warm up to it more and realized that my initial reaction had to do more with the changes and Malin Akerman's piss poor job as Laurie (Carla Gugino should have been the daughter). The 3rd time around I really enjoyed it for what it was; an attempt at adapting the unadaptable with flying colors. </p>
<p>I really wanted to love this movie as much as I had loved The Dark Knight, Iron Man, or even the LOTR trilogy but it isn't THE deconstruction I expected. And it occurred to me; so many other people in the world have so many different ideas of how it should have been done that it is impossible to be able to please EVERYONE. How many people would have framed things differently, juxtaposed this image to that, blah blah blah. It boils down to this: make that movie you want to see, write those stories you want to read, and when you have others critique it, realize that not everyone will agree with your direction. It was a labor of love for your source/content. Zack did a great job considering how much had to be taken out or crammed into the frame like pickled string beans. His dedication to the source material is commendable but not enough of a reason for him to direct The Dark Knight Returns. I'm sorry, but there needs to be a little more nuance, a little more satire than placing nipples on a costume as a throwback to ridiculous superheroes (Joel Schumacher, I don't like you very much). </p>
<p>All in all, Watchmen isn't for everyone but it isn't the disaster everyone is claiming it to be. Come this July, there is supposed to be a director's cut and then this Fall, a Freaky Deaky Director's cut with Tales of the Black Freighter (on DVD March 24th with the Under the Hood documentary) integrated into the director's cut of the movie. THIS may be the version many people wanted. But then again, a trilogy would have been BOSS!! I enjoyed it for what it was overall even though it took at least two tries. Enjoy it for what it is and if you separate the trade from the movie, you'll find yourself surprised. Thanks for the rant time, Jeff. </p>
