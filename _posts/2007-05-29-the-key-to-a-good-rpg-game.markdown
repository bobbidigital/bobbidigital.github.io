<p><img src="images/dnd.jpg" height="100" width="150" border="2" class="left">The other day we decided to run a one-off game. I guess the general consensus to the D&D games was that we were sick of trying to save the world. Don't get me wrong, great huge campaigns are wonderful, but we kind of missed the days of playing a single dungeon crawl that wasn't part of a huge overarching story line.</p>
<p>So we decided that we'd purchase one of the D&D classic adventures for 3rd edition and see how the game went. WOW. You wanna talk about fun? It was by far some of the best D&D action I've had in awhile. It sounds silly in a way when you consider I'm playing in one of the deepest most character driven campaigns that have ever existed. (Props to you Shawn)</p>
<p>But the classic module did something very simple that a lot of DM's seem to overlook. (Including yours truly) It keeps the dice flowing. You&acirc;&euro;&trade;re rolling dice just about every 15 seconds and that makes it fun! We're not talking all combat either. We're talking skill checks, attribute checks and of course some combat here and there. When you rely heavily on dice rolls it 1) continues to give the players a chance at risk or success. To use their character's attributes for something and 2) it further defines the separation between you and your character. Yes I might have a problem talking my way out of being hanged by the King when he caught me in bed with his Queen. But my character that has a +15 in bluff and a +12 in diplomacy is probably going to do it quite well.</p>
<p>So my advice is to find ways/reasons to get your folks rolling dice. It's going to make your game really fun and irresistible.</p>
