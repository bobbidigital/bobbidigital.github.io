I can only sum this up in a word. NOT!</p>
<p>First, I know I'm a research idiot, but I haven't been able to find this news on their website. I did see a few announcements in regards to old titles being re-released, but that doesn't constitute a change in business models.</p>
<p>Lets get real, remaking games is wonderful and nostalgic but the reality is your paying full price for a game you've already played. In some instances that's not a bad thing. Some people can enjoy a game two even three times through. (I am not one of those people) But to think that Square-Enix would actually change the entire model because of the success of a DS title to me sounds ludicrous.</p>
<p>Now understand that the likely hood that more remakes are coming is inevitable. <strong>Some</strong> of the classic remakes are cash cows waiting to happen.  Reinventing the business model though is horse shit. Living off of yest-er year's success just doesn't work for a sustainable amount of time. Just ask any producer in Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong> Note to Square-Enix:</strong> I love the old titles and wouldn't mind seeing some of the Japan only releases here in the states. But for the love of God, PLEASE keep the fresh content coming. You guys are too great to be relegated to the same status as the movie industry. Stay strong for us.</p>
