  content: do people think that this doesn't happen all the time?  i mean, maybe not
    3:48 worth of audio about it, but definitely happens all the time.  doesn't change
    my opinion of Bale at all.  so he's kinda a prick....big deal.  so is george lucas.  i
    still like star wars.

  content: It doesn't surprise me, but it still is quite a display. I mean it's a
    long bit of audio. But if you look at Bale's eyes you can clearly see the man
    is not stable. I mean for God's sake it's TERMINATOR. Not Hamlet. Reshoot the
    scene and move on.

  content: i thought the clip was pretty entertaining, though i did think he was way
    out of line. glad to see he took full responsibility for it today and apologize.

<p>From what I can tell it sounds like Bale was doing a scene in which the camera was focused on him. Behind the camera but in Bale's line of sight, the DP began to adjust some lighting. This must have broken Bale's concentration.</p>
<p>Listen to Bale as he rips Shane Hurlbut (the director of photography) a new asshole. </p>
