<p>So it seems some geniuses from NBC are <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117972829.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1">bringing back Knight Rider </a>to the small screen. </p>
<blockquote><p>Success of "Transformers" had a role in inspiring NBC Entertainment chief Ben Silverman's decision to revive "Knight." The thinking is that smallscreen f/x have advanced to the point where it'd be feasible to have a weekly series in which cars shift shapes.</blockquote></p>
<p>It sounds like they're more inspired by the advertising potential though. </p>
<blockquote><p>There's also huge potential for advertiser integration. General Motors was all over "Transformers," and it's easy to see NBC striking a rich deal with a single automaker to serve as the exclusive auto brand for the new "Knight." It's understood preliminary talks have already begun.</blockquote></p>
<p>Someone forgot about the evil Garthe Knight<br />

since  this sounded like an original twist.</p>
<blockquote><p>It's also likely the new show will explore the idea of "evil" cars to offset the heroic talking K.I.T.T. car of the original skein, which starred David Hasselhoff.</blockquote></p>
<p>At least they're going to put it in it's proper place, on the off season so we don't get bored watching reruns waiting for what we really want to watch to come out on DVD.</p>
<blockquote><p>But NBC execs no doubt feel "Knight Rider" is enough of a pre-sold brand to lure an audience. What's more, the telepic could serve as a good replacement for repeats come spring, perhaps replacing an encore of "Heroes" or "Bionic Woman."</blockquote></p>
<p>And in case anyone's wondering. I totally read this on a porn site before posting it here!</p>
