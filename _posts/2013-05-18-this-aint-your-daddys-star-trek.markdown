<p><em>Star Trek Into Darkness</em> is finally here! I'm not going to go into a detailed review of the movie, as plenty of people are discussing the pros and cons of the films. Let it be known that I enjoyed the film immensely, but have accepted the fact that this is not the Star Trek I know and love.</p></p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with this reboot being different from the original series both in tone and substance. In the first film, director J.J. Abrams skillfully rebooted the series in a way that didn't nullify the adventures from the late 60's and the movies. An alternate timeline offers Abrams the chance to re-imagine the series in his own way without being completely married to Roddenberry's vision.</p></p>
<p>The problem though is that Abrams doesn't divorce himself from the Enterprise's previous incarnation. The Abrams films attempt to establish themselves as their own, while simultaneously giving <strong>massive</strong> head nods to the original series. This approach works for films like <em>The Italian Job</em>, but it doesn't work so well for properties with massive followings like <em>Star Trek</em>.</p></p>
<p>Well, it almost doesn't work. The <a href="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/franchise/Star-Trek">box office tallies</a> are really the only opinion that the movie industry listens to and without question the reboot has been a smashing success. For people new to Trek, these films are exactly what they needed to dip their feet into the pool of the Federation. But if one were to go back and watch, even the last season of <em>The Next Generation</em>, they would be extremely confused, bored and disappointed.</p></p>
<p>With the mainstreaming of geek culture, science fiction is becoming quite a lucrative genre. But mainstreaming typically means a sort of homogenization of the content. The majority of science fiction films fail to even attempt to challenge our viewpoint of the world around us, the hallmark of a good sci-fi film. Instead lots of science fiction films devolve into <em>Die Hard</em> with spaceships and lasers. The Star Trek reboot is no different.</p></p>
<p>The reboot of the series is fantastic. I loved both films and I own the first on Blu-ray. But despite my Trek loyalty, I can't help but think of these films as disposable summer movies. In 15 years, we'll still be talking about Shatner, Nimoy and Kelley. We'll still be doing imitations of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRnSnfiUI54">iconic scenes</a> and still making <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&amp;NR=1&amp;v=GlY7YnWvZBU">parodies of those same scenes</a>. But in 15 years, where will <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1517976/">Pine</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0704270/?ref_=sr_1">Quinto</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0881631/?ref_=sr_1">Urban</a> be in our memories? Will the occupy our hearts and minds the way <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001772/?ref_=sr_1">Stewart</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000408/?ref_=sr_1">Frakes</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000984/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1">Brooks</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000684/?ref_=sr_1">Visitor</a> do?</p></p>
<p>The Star Trek reboot is a good thing for trekkies. It's putting the property back in the minds of the population. But what comes out may not be the product that we're looking for, but its still a product you can enjoy.</p></p>
