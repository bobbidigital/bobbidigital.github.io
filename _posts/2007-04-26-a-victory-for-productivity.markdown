<p><img src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/images/kGTD.gif" class="left" height="158" width="254" />Well my search for the perfect (digital) GTD Implementation continues. The funny thing is I have the best implementation in <a href="http://www.kinkless.com" target="_blank">Kinkless GTD</a>. The problem of course was mobility/portability and of course managing my corporate life. (Which subsequently belongs to a Windows world)</p>
<p>Well the good news is this. As a result of the boom in macs, we've gotten quite a number of complaints from our customers. Why? Because our web portal doesn't support Safari, until now. And with Safari, i've managed to piggy back my way into the exception process and can now bring my Mac back into the office. (Although it can't leave the department)</p>
<p>Mobility is a bit of a hurdle but I might have overcome it. Now that I can standardize on Kinkless GTD, syncing will handle updates on the mobile phone. I've also setup another Inbox for those times when I don't have my phone. I've got a vanilla folder for my Inbox during the day at work. I've also setup Gmail with a label for inbox. I have an automatic filter that will look for the subject of @INBOX and have it skip the mail accounts inbox and go straight to the label. It sounds shitty but so far it's been working nicely. When I do my review there are 2 major places I have to check for work, but all in all it's a solid process.</p>
<p>So i'll be attempting to further work the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;kinks&acirc;&euro;¬ù out of my system. The next issue I've got to tackle is note taking. I take a lot of notes at work, but how do I capture those notes digitally so that I can save, backup, search and group notes from a meeting? How can I keep that info instantly accessible? The only thing I could come up with for the time being is a program called <a href="http://journler.com/" target="_blank">Journler</a>. It does categories, tagging , smart folders. It's basically Yojimbo on steroids. So after a meeting I create a new entry, tag it accordingly and let it sit until I need it again.</p>
<p>Not the most elegant, but I've got a strange feeling I'm going to have to keep hunting and pecking until I find something that works. I'm still in the process of developing that Web based methodology. In fact, I put it in my Kinkless GTD doc =).</p>
