<p>Every time I see an email with an Excel spreadsheet attached to it, I die a little bit inside. When I scan the body of the e-mail and see the words "please send me your updates", I look for the closest pointy object and I try to carve my eyeballs out with it. In the 21st century you'd think there would be a better way of collaborating on documents than using the old attachments game. </p></p>
<p>Turns out there is, even if your company isn't hip enough to be using Google Docs. It's called Sharepoint and it's brought to you by the corporately blessed company, Microsoft. Sharepoint will save your team time, effort and eyeballs if you just give it a try. Here are 4 things that you should be using Sharepoint for, but you probably aren't.</p></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sharing Documents</strong>
<p>I know, it sounds basic. But in a corporate world with shrinking inbox size limits most people are living a Mad Max style of email management, desperately searching for hard drive space. When I see someone attaching a 2 megabyte word document I make a note to call them the minute my "Mailbox has reached size limits" notification shows up on my screen. (No matter the time)</p>
<p>Seriously people, upload it to Sharepoint and email the link. Not only does it save on disk space for your recipients, but it also ensures that people have access to the latest copy of the document at all times. Now you don't have to feel silly about fixing those typos and resending the document 30 minutes later. Fix the typos in the Sharepoint version and life is good.</p></li></p>
<li><strong>Version Control</strong>
<p>Did you know that Sharepoint has built in version control? It even has a "Checkout" feature, so that other users know when someone is currently working on the document. It even prevents others from editing it. When you check the document back in, it creates a new version of the document, but with the same file name. Users of the Sharepoint site can go back and look at previous versions of the document if they choose to or you can revert back to an older version. Now you can stop sending out new versions of the same document every 3 days! Your project team will <em>LOVE</em> you for this.</p>

<li><strong>List Items</strong>
<p>Excel is an extremely powerful tool. But like everything in life, humanity has dumbed it down to a few key functions that are primitive, yet indispensable and ingrained into our corporate cultures. Excel is often used as a simple list tool. I would say 95% of the spreadsheets I see are really just row/column lists with some filters but no real formulas applied. It's not uncommon for multiple people to need to make a change to data in these lists. Instead of playing "Spend my Saturday merging changes from 4 different spreadsheets", you could just implement a Sharepoint list.</p></p>
<p>Sharepoint lists are basically God's answer to this all too common problem. With a list you can create columns and rows manually or import them from an Excel spreadsheet. The functionality is basic, but it has more than enough for the simple lists that most people throw around. You can even add some simple field validation logic. But more importantly, people can edit the lists on the web and have their changes instantly saved and viewable by others. You can even export the list to Excel if you're feeling nostalgic. </p></p>
<p>Lists are a much more efficient way to coordinate changes. The updates are instant, the changes are tracked and you can now spend your Saturdays blowing off the things you said you would do "if only you had the time". For a bit of a tutorial or a walkthrough, check <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-sharepoint-services-help/working-with-sharepoint-lists-part-1-HA001119988.aspx">this out</a></p></li></p>
<li><strong>Task and Issue Tracking</strong>
<p>The bread and butter of any project manager is task and issue tracking. Everyone has been on that conference call where you're staring at a screen sharing session as someone solicits updates from everyone on the call. You watch in a dull trance as the PM transcribes the update, painfully aware of every typo made, every word omitted. Save yourself the embarrassment.</p></p>
<p>Sharepoint actually has an issue tracking list type. It creates all the usual task type fields for you. Now you can have your team members submit their own updates and progress reports. Admit it, you already feel more at ease about your next project meeting don't you?</p></p>

</ol></p>
<p>This is really just to get things started. There's so many other things companies and departments could be leveraging Sharepoint for. If we can just start using it for these 4 things though, life could be so much more efficient and injury free.</p></p>
