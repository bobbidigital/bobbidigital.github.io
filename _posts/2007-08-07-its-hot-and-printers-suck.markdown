  content: "So Jeff, I noticed you haven't been twittering much. Have you been moving?\r\n\r\nYeah,
    it's awful how printers, at least ink jet, are set up to insist they need new
    ink, even when they don't. I ended up buying a device to reset the Epson cartridges
    for my son's printer.\r\n\r\nIt worked for a while, but it's like a war where
    the other side is always making the next countermeasure. My son didn't print that
    much, and only in black, so it was ridiculous to be buying a bunch of new cartridges.
    He ended up just buying a laser printer (NOT Epson, of course).\r\n\r\nIt's like
    being held hostage, so I've been reluctant to even consider a color laser printer,
    lest I fall right into the trap!"

<p>It's hot in the office at home. Very hot. We're packing so I guess I'm required to be in it. But it's hot and the leather chair isn't making that much more enjoyable. To make it even sweeter, I attempted to print some documents today and my damn printer wouldn't work. Know why? Because the Ligth Magenta cartridge is out of ink. To answer your question, no, I'm not trying to print color. I'm trying to print black and white. But <a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supDetail.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&infoType=FAQ&oid=60202&prodoid=58654761&foid=64289">Epson themselves</a> have admitted to the printer not functioning if ANY of the print cartridges are expanded.</p>

<p>That's what the printer looks like. Stay away from it if encountered in the store. It makes great prints, but considering it's got 6 different colors at almost $15 bucks a pop, it's just not worth it. And even if you only print black and white, turns out a little bit of color is used in every print. <a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supDetail.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&infoType=FAQ&oid=60202&prodoid=58654761&foid=64240"> Again, by Epson's admission</a>. Good reasons to stay away or go broke with ink.</p>
