excerpt: "A young man stands on a street corner, baggy jeans and leather coat giving
  off the typical tough guy look. He&acirc;&euro;&trade;s tapping his foot nervously
  on the ground as he watches cars pass by. He&acirc;&euro;&trade;s late for a meeting.
  A car stops at a red light near the man and he rushes towards it, yanks the door
  open and slams the woman driver&acirc;&euro;&trade;s face into the steering wheel
  knocking her out before tossing the body out of the car. Without a second thought
  he speeds off with the car.\n\nThis is a typical scene that you could imagine from
  a movie or television show. Jack Bauer of the television series &acirc;&euro;&oelig;24&acirc;&euro;\x9D
  is often forced to resort to such tactics, sometimes performing acts such as this
  at gun point. Mobster movies are filled with acts of violence like this or much
  more appalling. The genre has become best known for this kind of ruthlessness by
  movies such as The Godfather, Casino and GoodFellas. \n\nWhat if I told you this
  scene was actually from a video game? It is in fact a scene from the highly anticipated
  and controversial game Grand Theft Auto 4. GTA4 is a game that delves the player
  into the criminal underworld. As a general henchmen you perform an assortment of
  dark criminal tasks from car theft, prostitution protection, to drug deals and gang
  hits. Yes this is not the Mario Brothers style game that I played when I was a kid.
  \n\nThe game has been the subject of much debate due to it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
  high level of violence and the types of activities you participate in as the game&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
  protagonist. But all of these arguments are predicated on the fact that gaming is
  for children and we have to protect the children. That is no longer the case as
  the gaming community is getting older and older year after year. The kids that were
  enthralled for hours by the game of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong\">Pong</a>
  are still playing video games. And as a result of the advances in technology, those
  same gamers are looking for a more immersive experience than what was acceptable
  20 years ago. So if the audience is more mature, isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t it reasonable
  that the audience would prefer more mature content?\n\n\n"

  content: "Jeff,\r\n\r\nI think the argument is muddled all over. Video games are
    not violent because 30 year old men play them. They are simply violent because
    action sells. Most of the games on the market are less violent (morally) than
    GTA4 will be. \r\n\r\nThere is a whole lot of shooting in most of the games I
    own but the bullets are aimed at Zombies. There are more minutes involving violent
    acts in God of War but most of that is against evil mythological creatures. \r\n\r\nGTA
    gets it's rep from the fact that th violence is (often) against a bystander (and
    then we laugh).\r\n\r\nI also think the Video Game industry is misleading us when
    they talk about the average age of \"The Gamer\". I can believe that the average
    age of a game purchaser is 30 years old but not the average age of a player. While
    it takes 2 non kids to make 1 kid, MOST 30 somethings I know have better things
    to do than play the 360 AND have kids they have a hard time entertaining.\r\n\r\nOne
    30 yo has to go make a purchase and from that point on it's X-Box time for the
    kids (who unless they are very undersocialized, have friends).\r\n\r\nThe Wii
    probably changed this somewhat but it just doesn't fly that the average age of
    a gamer is as high as that. Comics I understand but gaming. No way.\r\n\r\nNow
    it's true that we give film directors awards for their violent creativity but
    we do so because that's aimed at US. We'd yank any award Robert Rodriguez would
    ever get from Spy Kids if it became El Mariachi and starred Hannah Montanna.\r\n\r\nThere
    is a different argument to be made for which films get those awards too. We have
    a societal double standard on what is just great drama with violence (Sopranos,
    Departed) and what is just passed off as violence with some drama (Oz, damn near
    any Black Gangster Film not called Training Day).\r\n\r\nDoc M"

&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Why does it have to be so violent?&acirc;&euro; Video games, like most forms of entertainment is a form of escapism and in many respects a type of voyeurism. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a chance for us to experience a life that we maybe intrigued about, but are limited from participating in by physical, practical or moral barriers. Why do we play football video games? Most of us love the sport and would love to experience the rush of being part of a game. Of making the game deciding throw or catching the ball in the end zone. Now me being 30 my chances of getting drafted into the NFL are probably slim. Video games allow me that experience, albeit not quite as satisfying as the actual one.</p>
<p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s naive to think that violence and the criminal underworld isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t intriguing to us as human beings. Everyone has a dark fetish for excitement deep inside. Why do we watch gangster movies? It gives us a chance to peek into this world of intrigue and danger, without violating any of the social contracts we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re bound too. (Also keeps us out of jail) But that doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t make it any less fascinating! So what if you could participate in this world, without breaking laws or social norms? Wouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t anyone be interested in that? Paintball is what? A simulation of war. Nobody would say that paintball is going to make a child grow up to become a war monger. Again it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a type of escapism. A way to participate in something that is taboo by society.</p>
<p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not writing this to suggest that the game is not violent or that children should be allowed to play it. My argument is, if we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re going to begin banning games such as GTA4 when do we start banning similar movies? <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407887/">The Departed</a>, arguably one of the most violent movies ever made, won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2006. (As well as 3 others) So if this violence is accepted in film why not video games? If Rockstar Games (the developer of the GTA series) is painted as a careless and irresponsible company, what does that make Leonardo DiCaprio? Martin Scorsese? Are they the devil in disguise?</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Well movies have ratings&acirc;&euro;. So do video games. Most parents are not aware of the video game rating system. <a href="http://www.esrb.org/index-js.jsp">The Entertainment Software Ratings Board</a> has a <a href="http://www.esrb.org/ratings/ratings_guide.jsp">detailed list</a> on their website. GTA4 specifically is rated as &acirc;&euro;&oelig;M&acirc;&euro; for Mature. The rating is very similar to the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;R&acirc;&euro; rating given by the <a href="http://www.mpaa.org/">MPAA</a> for films. Is it enough? Maybe not. Maybe the ESRB should give it the Adults Only rating. But these are the same arguments that can be given in film or in television. Jack Bauer may shoot an innocent to get what he wants on an episode of 24. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s for the higher good so it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s OK? </p>
<p>Violence in video games is on the rise, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;new&acirc;&euro; trend by any means. Motion Pictures started as silent films of slapstick comedy. It wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t until Taxi Driver (by Martin Scorsese again) that violence in films really began to take off. As the medium matured, so did the audience and so did the content. Violence in video games is tabooed by parents because the idea is predicated on the fact that gamers are all children. The Entertainment Software Association however tells us that the<a href="http://www.theesa.com/facts/gamer_data.php"> average gamer age</a> is 33. Is a 33 year old entitled to a violent video game if he wants it? Or should we force him to play Mario Brothers for the rest of his life? Maybe Scorsese should be forced to make kid friendly films too. </p>
