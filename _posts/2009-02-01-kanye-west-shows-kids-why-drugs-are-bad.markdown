  content: He is a materalistic dork that looks hideous. When are people going to
    wake up and realize having money doesn&#39;t make you have more taste or style
    then anyone else.He proves this point beyond words.Does anyone listen to his music
    anyway?He tries way too hard.He is a waste of human flesh,I think he knows that
    hence all of his "trappings" to overcome his insecurity.

<p>Any child in the world who sees this video of Kanye West will swear off drugs forever. This must be a stream of consciousness. I'm not sure if we were intended to comprehend this. Kids, this is what you sound like when you get high. Only you're in your friends basement instead of in "Paris, chillin".</p>
<p>Kanye you entertain us in so many ways. Thank you.</p>
