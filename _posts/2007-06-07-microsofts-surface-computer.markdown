<p><img src="images/surface.jpg" height="187" width="187" border="2" class="right">So if you follow any tech-news you've undoubtedly heard about Microsoft's new computing platform called "Surface". If you haven't heard of it, here's the 50,000 foot view.</p>
<p>It's a touch screen coffee table, in a nutshell. </p>
<p>Granted this statement doesn't fully capture the device's "cool" factor, but once the initial shock of how awesome this thing is you'll find yourself making the comparison more and more. </p>
<p>The platform is something out of a sci-fi movie, most notably Minority Report. The types of things you can do with this are absolutely amazing. But in reality I think all they'll ever be is cool. To see what I mean, go ahead and watch this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlZxuqjJDgk">video demonstration of Surface</a>. Pretty damn cool huh?</p>
<p>Practical applications are obviously going to be in hotels, kiosks, high end restaurants etc. But is Surface just a novelty item? I mean can you imagine actually doing any type of day to day computing on an interface such as this? Maybe I'm just old school but my primary problem with it as a regular computing platform is still input. The same problem I have with smartphones and PDA's. There is no easy method of getting raw thoughts INTO the device to actually make them useful. Manipulating existing data is probably a snap, but when I sit down and do a brain dump I don't want to type on a non-tactile surface, or a miniature qwerty keyboard or with a touch screen stylus. I guess if they got used to it in Star Trek it won't take us long either, but I'm just not sold on it yet. All of the really cool applications for it, don't make much sense when you imagine the cost vs. it's overall versatility. Yes looking at a google map together and touching the interface would be awesome. But worth it? Playing with photos on the coffee table and resizing stretching and flipping through them would be awesome, but worth it?</p>
<p>Of course most of my points are null and void considering the price tag on this item. Estimates have come in around $10,000 dollars per unit which isn't bad for businesses. But for most of us it's still a tad bit out of range. But this is such a leap forward in the way we interact with our data (and it's various forms) that it can only be expected to have such a high price point. In time the prices will come down and by then maybe they'll have solved some of my woes for personal computing. (The most practical input form would be voice) But until then, I can't wait to see this thing in action.</p>
<p>I just want to say to Microsoft as much as it pains me, this thing looks pretty damn awesome. It looks like you've innovated in a way that you haven't done in quite some time. And this is coming from a straight up apple fan boy, so it pains me to say it. Keep em coming!</p>

<p>p.s. Too bad it still has to run Vista. Which brings up another point. Who's going to write consumer apps for this thing anyways?</p>
