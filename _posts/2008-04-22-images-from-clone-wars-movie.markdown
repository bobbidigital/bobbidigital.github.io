<p>Empire Online has exclusive photos of the new Star Wars <em>Clone Wars</em> movie, an animated film scheduled to hit theaters this year.</p>
<p>Now I heard it was going to be a CGI film. When I heard that, I thought along the lines of the <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0173840/" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within</em> </a>film.&Acirc;&nbsp; Instead the film looks more like a cut scene from an N64 game.&Acirc;&nbsp; There's a particular style to it and I'm sure it'll grow on me. I'm just a little let down and disappointed.</p>
