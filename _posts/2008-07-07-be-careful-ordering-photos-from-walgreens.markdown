<p class="MsoNormal">When I flew back home to visit my family and friends in New York, I took a bunch of photos while I was there. My sister is a bit of a photo nut and we don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t really have many family photos, so I promised to send her some when I got home.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I decided to just have them printed at Walgreens and have her pick them up at a local store near her. <span> </span>I sent the photos and paid for them online with my credit card. My sister goes to pick up the photos but didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t realize I had already paid for them. <span> </span>When she got them from the photo lab she said to the cashier &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d like to grab a few other things and just cash out at the same time.&acirc;&euro;<span> </span>She does some minor shopping, goes to the register and lets the cashier ring it all out. <span> </span>So while she&acirc;&euro;&trade;s digging through her purse to get her money out, the cashier hands her the goods and a receipt. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Thanks and have a good day&acirc;&euro; the cashier responds. My sister, dumbfounded, asks &acirc;&euro;&oelig;But I haven&acirc;&euro;&trade;t paid for anything.&acirc;&euro;</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Oh we charged it to the card that paid for the photos&acirc;&euro; the cashier says in a helpful tone.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My sister tries to get the transaction reversed, but unfortunately there is some song and dance about how it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a one time transaction and due to the fact it was initiated online she couldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t reverse it. But I guess my question is how do you let someone charge additional items to a credit card? Wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t my transaction for the photos closed? I paid for them already. How does this become a revolving door for credit charges?</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I intend to write a very serious letter to Walgreens regarding this. I have a friend that works in their customer service department. But how does something like this happen? Part of it I see as a cashier error, because she should have 1) asked for the card at the very least or 2) asked to see some identification. Considering my SISTER&acirc;&euro;&trade;S name is Gloria, I would imagine it would be fairly straight forward to identify that she&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not me. My sister and I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t even have the same last name! But isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t this also a technical error? How does the cash register allow her to ring out more goods on an already closed transaction?</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll be interesting to see exactly how Walgreens explains this one. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m deeply troubled.</p></p>
