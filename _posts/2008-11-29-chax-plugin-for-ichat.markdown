<p><a href="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/chax.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-467 alignleft" style="margin: 5px; border: 5px solid black;" title="chax" src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/chax.png" alt="" width="128" height="128" /></a>I will not dispute that <a href="http://www.adiumx.com" target="_blank">Adium</a> is the champ when it comes to instant messaging on the Mac. But every heavyweight champion has his weaknesses and Adium is no different. My main gripe with Adium is it's lack of consistency in the realm of file transfers. I often need to send or receive a file through an IM client and Adium tends to fall flat on it's face. In all fairness to the Adium developers, they rely on a library called libpurple. This library (and by extension Adium) has trouble handling file transfers in firewall situations. But because libpurple is maintained by someone else, there is no time table from Adium on when this will be fixed.</p>
<p>So with that in mind I present to you a <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/20056">Chax plugin</a> for iChat. Why you say? Well my biggest gripe with iChat is the fact that it doesn't handle tabbed windows.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/chax-screen-shot.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-466 alignright" style="margin: 5px; border: 5px solid black;" title="chax-screen-shot" src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/chax-screen-shot-300x226.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="158" /></a>Every chat session in iChat opens in a seperate window by default. I hate that. With Chax a few menu options will allow you to have multiple chat conversations in a single window. Another pain in the ass feature about iChat is that if you login with multiple AIM accounts, each buddy list will show up as a separate window in iChat. Chax can fix that for you as well with the "Use All Contacts as Primary Contact List" option. (In the iChat preferences window under CHAX -> General)</p>
<p>Now if we could just get iChat to support a few other protocols it would be perfect. I also forgot that Adium isn't so hot on the audio and video chatting either, yet another reason to use iChat. Chax makes it just a little less painful to do. Check it out.</p>
