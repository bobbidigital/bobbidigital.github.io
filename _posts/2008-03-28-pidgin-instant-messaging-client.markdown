  content: I was following your posts on twitter and installed.  Was just about to
    uninstall until I read that it had gTalk (which I overlooked) LOL.  Testing it
    out.  It's cool ~ thanks for mentioning it!

<p>When I'm on my Mac I'm in sinful bliss with the <a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium</a> chat application. (If you own a Mac and your not using it stop reading and download it now) But the reality of life is that we (or at least I) still live in a Windows dominated world. So when I come into work, I'm left to a few poor solutions.</p>
<p>I've checked out <a href="http://www.miranda-im.org/">Miranda IM </a>and wasn't too pleased with it. If I can't get a chat client up and running with all my services in a matter of minutes, then I don't bother. Granted Miranda might be a fine client. I just have no patience.</p>
<p>I've checked out Trillian and my two major complaints are it's stability and lack of GTalk interfaces.&Acirc;&nbsp; The paid version does allow you to connect to GTalk.</p>
<p>Then in comes <a href="http://www.pidgin.im" target="_blank">Pidgin</a>. Pidgin is a nice Open Source client. It's lightweight, connects to all my services and was very easy to setup and configure.&Acirc;&nbsp; So if you're looking for a Trillian replacement I would give Pidgin a whirl for sure.</p>
