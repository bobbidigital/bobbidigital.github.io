Won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be much soon. Google has quietly launched their pseudo office application called Docs and Spreadsheets. Currently the suite only consists of a Word Processor and a spreadsheet program, but I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m sure it won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be long before they expand on that as well.</p>
<p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve played with both applications and I have to admit it seems fully functional. Although I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t quite feel comfortable with the idea of Google having even more of my personal information. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s well known that Google stores just about everything that happens in their servers. (So if you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re searching for sick porn, be careful, they know) But typically t hat information has been limited to search results and search sets.&Acirc;&nbsp; Now Google will have access to your data. I have a few questions with that though.</p>
<p>1.&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; &Acirc;&nbsp;Does Google peek into my data? I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m going to guess that they do.<br />
2.&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; &Acirc;&nbsp;Who owns my data? It lives on the Google servers, but where does possession really live? Does Google own my data because it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s on their server?<br />
3.&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; &Acirc;&nbsp;More of a statement then a question. I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t like the idea of web applications. I know Web 2.0 is supposed to bring us this new age of thin web based applications, but is the web really up to the challenge?</p>
<p>So how much do you trust Google? This seems like the next logical step seeing how we already trust them with our videos, email, searches and chats. But isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t this a tad much? Maybe I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m just paranoid.</p>
