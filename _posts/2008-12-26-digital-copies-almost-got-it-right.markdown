  content: I agree but Hwood and the studios want as much bang for their buck as possible.
    They have been doing the same for SD DVDs as well (Dark City Director's Cut offered
    it but only in WMV format. BS I say). Eventually, physical media could die out
    but there are some consumers who still like having that material to hold like
    a bound book over something like Kindle or Sony's E-Reader. I say direct port
    to the brain ala Exiztenz.

<p>I really like the option of getting a digital copy of a movie when you buy it on Blu-ray. (I'm not sure if this is also available on DVD or not) For those that don't know, a lot of Blu-Ray movies these days are allowing you to also get a digital copy of the movie. So when you buy the movie, you get a CD with a redemption code on it. You put it in, input your code and the movie downloads from iTunes free of charge.</p>
<p>This solves some of the major problems with digital distribution. That being that some (including myself) just dont' feel comfortable with their library being entirely 0's and 1's. I know it's the exact same concept as music, but for some reason with music it just FEELS more acceptable. Part of that feeling is probably due to the large amounts of hard drive space needed to store your digital movie library. Unless I buy hard drives by the palette, it's difficult for me to keep my entire library available via digital copy.</p>
<p>With this being said, the digital copy solution offers a great opportunity for people to be introduced to downloaded movies. But I suggest that we reverse the process. Why not allow me to buy the digital copy via iTunes so I can watch it immediately and then ship me the physical copy? This just seems so much more intuitive to me. I would love to be sitting on my couch, surfing for a movie and decide to buy it, knowing I'll have a physical copy on my door in days. Add in a little option for me to select DVD or Blu-Ray and it would be downright heaven.</p>
<p>This makes much more sense to me.</p>
