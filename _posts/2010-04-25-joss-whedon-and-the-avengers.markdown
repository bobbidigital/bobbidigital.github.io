  content: For one, CONGRATS on the MARRIAGE!!! I have been busier than you know what
    with these twin girls. HOLY CRAP! But onwards, I agree that Whedon was an acquired
    taste for me as well (Buffy, eh, and Serenity is what got me into Firefly, and
    I had to pass on Dollhouse for personal reasons) but I believe that he can pull
    off having the quipping camaraderie amongst certain members (Ant-Man and Hawkeye
    come to mind as well as Tony Stark) mashed with the action that must follow. My
    concern is more with Kenneth Branagh and Thor. And to be fair, Jon Favreau is
    a much more rounded director than Whedon. Favreau came from Swingers and the kinda
    forgetful Made, and is a commercial director but he is a smart director who can
    mix up his own unique take with the appeal an audience will go for. Whedon may
    have his fanbase but he still has a chance to become even more of a name. And
    Alien:Resurrection was no worse than Alien3. I mean look at Fincher&#39;s career?
    A:R was the American debut of a French director of City of Lost Children and Delicatessen;
    wouldn&#39;t expect about 85% of that mofo to be lost in translation? ;-) Be good
    and I&#39;ll drum up some content here.

<p>I'll be honest. The news about Whedon <a href=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20100414/film_nm/us_whedon_2">possibly directing</a> the Avengers movie makes me nervous. Joss Whedon is one of the best creative minds in the genre. He's an acquired taste that I didn't quite understand at first. But after <a href="http://www.allthingsdork.com/?p=394">some more exposure</a> to him I was a converted to the church of Whedon.</p>
<p>Despite his enormous success among the geek community, he hasn't really been a commercially viable director. His only experience as a <strong>movie</strong> director is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379786/">Serenity</a>, the big screen wrap up of the failed television series <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461/">Firefly</a>. The film was received well by fans as was the show, but the rest of the world didn't really give a shit. Enjoyment from the fans is all we really care about right? Yes and no. Not to mention that the Avengers is a clearly different beast.</p>
<p>Joss Whedon does great with creating characters and breathing life into them. However, his writing and direction style is very distinct. Everything <strong>feels</strong> very Whedonesque. It's entertaining and warm in its familiarity, but this is when you're entering a world where you have no expectations of the characters. </p>
<p>Not only are the Avengers firmly in our mind from years of comics, but they're also being re-enforced by films released in the last few years. Fan boys (like me) may not be interested in Whedon's take on the characters, but more continuing the character's persona from their previous origin films. I'm not sure if Whedon knows how to do this or not. The only chance he's ever had was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118583/">Alien: Resurrection</a>, and we all remember how that turned out don't we?</p>
<p>If anyone has the chops to surprise me, it's Joss Whedon. I wait for the official word on his signing with trepidation. I'm not sure if it's a win or a loss. I thought the same thing about <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0269463/">Jon Favreau</a> when he was selected to direct the Iron Man movies. And we all remember how that turned out don't we?</p>
