<p>Despite popular opinion I still draw breath on a semi-regular basis. Things have been pretty busy around these parts. I've sunk more into the corporate drudge of life as always seems to happen from time to time. Management becomes more of a reality and I spend less time doing the fun stuff and more time doing the "manager" thing to do. All in all it plays out well. (and pays out well)</p>
<p>So much has been going on it's difficult to sum it all up in just a few sentences. Things have been going great with Stephanie. We just got back from Virginia for Easter weekend and I got to meet some of the extended family. A really nice group of people and I'm happy to report that I felt comfortable with everyone around. It was nice to be able to put faces to the e-mail addresses.</p>
<p>My film making has been going well. I'm in post production on a project that we shot in March and in pre-production on a new podcast as well as new web TV show. (stay tuned for that) I've been trying to do as much reading on the subject as possible. I don't know where all the hours in the day seem to go. It's to the point where I feel guilty if I just sit around and watch a movie. I always feel like I should be DOING something. Oh well, hopefully it'll pass.</p>
<p>This weekend I flew for the first time. I felt good about it, until I realized the TSA managed to check us twice, pat us down and send us through the extra security check, but still managed to let Stephanie board with a vicious cork screw in her purse. So terrorist, if your out there cork screws are the way to go.</p>
<p>Stephanie is in the bedroom waiting for me so we can fornicate. I'm going to bed. Good to say hi and come up for air. Happy Birthday Ed.</p>
