  content: I agree with you totally.  Lucas comes from the old days of science fiction
    film which was all about creatures and harrowing escapes (War of the Worlds, The
    Blob, all those Saturday matinees, Flash Gordon serials).  So he went that path
    with the original trilogy but what actually happened was characterization due
    to the quality of actors (Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alec Guiness, etc). The
    first film I believe had to have dialogue writers come in and re-write most of
    Lucas' dialogue.  He was a geek that focused so much on the special effects and
    creatures.  Granted those things were awesome but the reason I think our generation
    likes the original films better is because of the characters.  Everything just
    clicked between Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Mark Hamill. They were a team
    throughout each film.  All the other characters complemented the story well too.  In
    the newer films, you just don't have that chemistry.  The most memorable films
    and TV shows are all because of their characters.  Granted I LOVE the special
    effects of the newer films (the opening scene in Revenge of the Sith is amazing)
    but the characters just blow.  The Thrawn trilogy would be excellent.

  content: Clone wars was a ploy to release more toys. I'm convinced of it. The movie
    itself lent NOTHING to the universe and introduced a character (the new padawan)
    that could have had potential if we didn't already know that she was somehow lost
    and forgotten by the next film and probably killed by Anakin himself. But god
    damned have you seen the complete new line of toys that Lucas owns all the rights
    and profits to? The movies doesn't even have to break even for him to make ANOTHER
    billion off of it. I want to punch him in the dick until he dies from it. That
    cocksucker.

<p>This post is going to be extremely wrong and cold and a perfect explanation of everything that's wrong with the world.&Acirc;&nbsp; It will expose me for the evil, vengeful man that I am and quite possibly alienate some of my readers. But I always said that I would try to be truthful on this blog as much as possible, so I'm going to say what I've been feeling for a long time.&Acirc;&nbsp; It is also a bit of an angry rant. You've been warned.</p>
<p>Star Wars will be better when George Lucas dies.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-433"></a></p>
<p>That's a harsh thing to say and I don't wish death on the man. But unlike some creators, Lucas has become more of a hindrance to the franchise rather than a beacon of hope and an inspiration of evangelism. Instead we're treated to 3 hour bouts of audio/video retardation and an animated movie from which I heard did no better.</p>
<p>Lucas, you are a conceptual genius. You have an incredible talent for story, characters, settings and backgrounds. You're dialogue sounds as forced as that first bathroom break before a long road trip. ("Get it all out now Johnny cause we won't be stopping!) The words are so contrived that your actors have this look as if someone requested a vile audacious act from them. If you ever want to reproduce it, ask your pastor in the middle of church for a line of blow. Same look. But Star Wars is your baby, so I can understand that you want to hold it close to you. You want&Acirc;&nbsp; to protect it and look out for its best interests. The only problem is you can't anymore. You're an unfit parent, trying to maintain custody of a child that has outgrown your means to provide for it. You have to release that child into the open and let it become what it will.</p>
<p>The prequels (IMHO) have done nothing to add to the Star Wars mythos. It's a collection of scenes that found ways to introduce us to "cool new and exciting creatures" (gag) or connect us to already established characters from the previous 3 films. The acting is horrible in most cases and not due to the actors. Imagine how hard it is to encompass yourself in an off world reality when you're surrounded by a simply colored green or blue wall and instead of talking to an actor you're looking at a head on a long stick. I'm no Morgan Freeman, but I can imagine that's a pretty difficult thing to do.</p>
<p>So what's going to happen when George Lucas passes on?&Acirc;&nbsp; We might actually see the Thrawn Trilogy converted into films. (If you haven't read the Thrawn Trilogy Click <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=Star+Wars+Thrawn&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_self">HERE</a> and buy numbers 1, 2 and 3 in the list.) If not the Thrawn Triliogy then maybe another book, there's really an endless supply of content already made. I haven't read a ton of Star Wars books, but the biggest thing i've noticed between new writers for the franchise and Lucas is that new writers are content with the way things are. They don't try to "explain" how things work in the Star Wars universe. They work with what their given.&Acirc;&nbsp; Lucas really ticked me off with "midi-chlorians" or whatever the hell they're called. We don't need an explanation for how the force works. The same way we don't need an explanation on Gandalf's staff or the psychology of the ring bearer. Mystery is a good thing in fiction sometimes.</p>
<p>I just think that Lucas's ability to tell a good story has diminished quite a bit. If there was ever more evidence than the prequels, it would probably be the latest Indiana Jones film. (In fairness to Lucas he is only credited with the story, while David Koepp is credited with the actual screenplay. Don't be fooled by this little bit of information. Lucas had a very heavy hand in the screenplay) Lucas's strangelhold on his licenses stifles the creative process in my opinion.</p>
<p>Of course this is all arm chair quarterbacking, but I think once the reigns are lifted, Star Wars will get reinvigorated with good content. Or it could go the way of Apple when Steve Jobs left. Only time will tell.....that came out really wrong.</p>
