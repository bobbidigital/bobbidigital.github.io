  content: That difference between work/life computing is something I've struggled
    with for a while, but mostly because I never want to use a computer that is owned
    by my employer for personal tasks. I like knowing that I have full possession
    over some things. I've slowly been migrating closer to where you are though, just
    because it's getting progressively more difficult to keep things artificially
    separated. Even now though I still keep an email address and phone number that
    I try to only use for freelance stuff, and keep it out of my main inbox. Closing
    in on starting to think "What's the point?" though.

  content: I had the same hangup in regards to personal on a work machine. My original
    approach was to buy my own machine and use it for work. (My company's usage policy
    allows for that, with certain restrictions) But then I realized how arbitrary
    this distinction is. I still do personal things on my work laptop. They're called
    "Incidental usage". But most of the personal stuff I do is via the browser. (Blog
    posts for example) Plus most acceptable usage policies are so strict, they're
    basically saying "We can fire anyone in the company using this." Because restricting
    a computer to a core set of applications is tantamount to strangling productivity.

<p>I was recently allowed the awesome chance to switch my work laptop from a dull Dell Latitude, to a nice shiny new Macbook Pro with Retina display! It has been a radical transformation in my work/personal computing balance. No longer do I need to segregate my activities to fit my active persona. I'm also extremely more productive as my work and personal to-dos become intertwined.</p></p>
<p>Some people may read that and instantly think "He's making phone calls on company time!" That's true, but the truth is most people <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/04/30/179072692/when-it-comes-to-productivity-technology-can-hurt-and-help">are not spending 40 hours a week being productive</a> at work. We take water cooler breaks, check Facebook and Twitter, and occasionally get lost in a sea of YouTube cat videos. But in my case, my lost productivity during the 9-5 shift is more than made up during the off hours when I'm on a call at 11pm or working on a change over the weekend.</p></p>
<p>Previously I had two separate GTD implementations, one for my personal stuff in Omnifocus and another for work <a href="http://www.allthingsdork.com/?p=678">using Microsoft OneNote</a>. The problem though is that I had to decide which mode I was in and open/react accordingly. I had 2 separate inboxes and 2 different sets of motivations for GTD. With a single solution now, I simply blow through my tasks, no matter where I'm at or <strong>when</strong> I'm at it. Saturday morning, I wake up and my task is to read some documentation for work. Done. Then I write a blogpost, then I finish writing that python script for the upgrade. My life never becomes "work/personal" it's all just stuff that needs to get done. Yes, sometimes that means I'm writing a blogpost at work or making a doctor appointment for my daughter after my change management meeting. But it all balances out in the end. (My output at work is proof of that)</p></p>
<p>Now that I have this seamless experience across work, home and mobile (all running Omnifocus), it forces me to re-examine how I deal with contexts. I find myself using applications more as a context than simply "Computer". With an array of mobile and desktop apps at my disposal, I don't necessarily need to be at a computer. I may have a context simply titled <a href="http://mindnode.com">Mind Node</a> for my brainstorming work. When I have music albums that I need to check out, I now have a context called Spotify. This list will continue to grow as I integrate more applications into the totality of my computing life.</p></p>
<p>This may sound like the ultimate destruction of work-life balance, but for me it brings it all into a closer harmony. My views on this may differ because I've spent a decade being on-call, which forces the blurring of these lines anyways. But the truth of the matter is, I enjoy being plugged in. Being plugged in helps me keep a pulse on things, maintain <a href="http://inboxzero.com">Inbox Zero</a> and get my to-dos routed to the right place as they come in. All of these things together, keeps me from being overwhelmed with the amount of <del>work</del> tasks that I need to perform.</p></p>
<p>The key is to ask yourself, does my job allow me to (reliably) erect firewalls between personal and professional. In most IT fields, it seems like that possibility is eroding, but that doesn't have to be a bad thing! If you're at a director level or above, you likely have no chance of leaving work at the office after 5pm. By tearing down the wall between your work and personal life, you have the potential of actually creating <strong>more</strong> flexibility, not less. Of course this is all dependent on your job and the type of role you have.</p></p>
<p>This may not work for everyone, and your mileage may vary, but for me, the breaking down of the work/personal walls have been a tremendous boom.</p></p>
