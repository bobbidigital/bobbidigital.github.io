<p><img src="images/phone.gif" class="right" border="0" width="150" height="125"> A phrase I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m very sick of hearing.  Since the move we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve been spending a lot of time calling companies for various household services and as a result spending a lot of time with IVRs. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not so much that I have a problem with IVRs. I have a problem with the IVRs that ask you to SPEAK what you want as opposed to providing you with a list of options. Then you get that voice that just TOTALLY pisses you off when it says &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Hmmmm&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;.I didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t quite get that&acirc;&euro;.</p>
<p>Now let me ask you, what added benefit do I get from SPEAKING what I want as opposed to just pressing the touch tone pad? It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s even better when they say, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Just say what you want!!&acirc;&euro;  Is it really that easy? No, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not. The computer has a list of keywords that it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s looking for and if you don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t mention one of those keywords guess what you get in response. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Hmmmm&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;.I didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t quite get that&acirc;&euro;. Well if you provided me with my options than maybe I could have said something you&acirc;&euro;&trade;d understand!</p>
<p>Have you ever tried repeating a telephone number to one of these things? I had no idea that the word SEVEN and the word ZERO sounded so much a like. Or maybe I have some type of speech impediment. Or perhaps my tongue is to fat to properly articulate the nuances of the word. Either way, it bothers me even LISTENING to people try and repeat their telephone number to an IVR.</p>
<p>So if the IVR isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t a pleasant customer experience, than it must be saving the company a ton of cash right? How? Aside from my cell phone bill, I have never used an IVR that provided information for me without needing to speak to a customer service representative. And even when I do get the customer service representative, she or he is never the person I need to talk to anyways, so they just end up transferring me. </p>
<p>And speaking of customer service reps, I think they get the worse end of the stick with the whole deal. For starters companies get an IVR and think &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Oh this will reduce the number of calls to reps, so we can get rid of them&acirc;&euro;. That sucks. But then to make it better when they finally DO get the call they get every drop of aggravation, frustration and rage that the IVR created, ALL IN THE FACE when we finally get to them.</p>
<p>My apologies to all the service reps that got ripped a new one as a result of some bean counters great idea. The only thing those IVRs are good for is reminding me of just how far away we are from Artificial Intelligence.</p>
