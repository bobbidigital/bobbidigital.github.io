excerpt: "For those of you that don't know I guess I should start off with what the
  hell I'm talking about. Comcast has decided to institute bandwidth caps for all
  subscribers beginning on the 1st of October. Another way to phrase it would be that
  Comcast is finally making public, the caps that have always existed but just weren't
  made available to the general public. (Which makes you wonder how they get away
  with advertising as \"Unlimited\") I'm going to try and be as fair and even-handed
  as possible while I make a few points, so that this doesn't come off as a Comcast
  bash session, even though I have very little love for the company.\r\n\r\nFirst
  off Comcast isn't the only company experimenting with the idea of bandwidth caps
  although it is the first to make them official. The cap set by Comcast is 250gb
  per month. That sounds like an awful lot of data and will absolutely be sufficient
  for the 80th percentile of customers, possibly more. But what about those few that
  do exceed their limit legitimately? Content producers, video downloaders etc? They'll
  just pay the overage charge and move on with their lives right? Wrong! Comcast currently
  has a policy that would result in a warning the first time a user exceeds their
  limit and the second time they exceed their limit the offenders account will be
  banned for 1 year! Not to mention with no overage plan you simply get your Internet
  shutoff for the rest of the month.\r\n\r\n"

  content: 'Amen!!! These jackasses are going backwards. The stewardship of the public
    internet should be removed from their care. Caps and tiers should be the talk
    of yesterday. We gave them the telecommunications act of 1996 to allow them to
    profit to the point they could provide free internet to every American. Instead,
    they gave raises to their CEO''s. Our internet infrastructure is a laughing stock
    of the world. The great USA, #40 in broadband penetration and speed. Way to go!'

    there were still quite a few folks here in the Houston area without internet.
    Comcast's had a fiber-optic cable sitting on the ground in our backyard for weeks,
    I don't know if it's a good one that's working, an old one or what. I guess they're
    too busy to come back and do something with it.\r\n\r\nI don't know what it is,
    but Comcast seems to garner more complaints than anything else on the internet,
    it makes me glad I've got DSL. Some friends of mine are switching to DSL and will
    probably have that up and running before Comcast ever gets fixed."

<p>For those of you that don't know I guess I should start off with what the hell I'm talking about. Comcast has decided to institute bandwidth caps for all subscribers beginning on the 1st of October. Another way to phrase it would be that Comcast is finally making public, the caps that have always existed but just weren't made available to the general public. (Which makes you wonder how they get away with advertising as "Unlimited") I'm going to try and be as fair and even-handed as possible while I make a few points, so that this doesn't come off as a Comcast bash session, even though I have very little love for the company.</p>
<p>First off Comcast isn't the only company experimenting with the idea of bandwidth caps although it is the first to make them official. The cap set by Comcast is 250gb per month. That sounds like an awful lot of data and will absolutely be sufficient for the 80th percentile of customers, possibly more. But what about those few that do exceed their limit legitimately? Content producers, video downloaders etc? They'll just pay the overage charge and move on with their lives right? Wrong! Comcast currently has a policy that would result in a warning the first time a user exceeds their limit and the second time they exceed their limit the offenders account will be banned for 1 year! Not to mention with no overage plan you simply get your Internet shutoff for the rest of the month.</p>

<p>The biggest failure is Comcast's apparent disregard for "easing" customers into this new model. Tools to monitor your bandwidth usage? They're out there, but don't look to Comcast to provide anything. Wondering just how close you get to that 250gb cap? Again Comcast isn't providing any historical usage patterns in order to help you gauge where you fall. Again in Comcast's defense, this will not effect the majority of users in a direct fashion. (More indirectly which I'll detail later) But for that percentage of people who are impacted are these things that are wrong to ask for? You could put a lot of people at ease when they find out they only use 110GB per month on their heaviest months. Or you could get a lot of customers switching to business class accounts when they see they're well above the 250GB mark. It avoids Comcast from having to terminate customers because of heavy usage, something that will seriously leave a PR black eye.&Acirc;&nbsp; In addition to that, if anyone is going over 250GB per month I can almost guarantee you that those are some of the most vocal voices on the Internet. Trust me Comcast, you don't need that bad PR on the web.</p>
<p>We can bitch and moan all we want but the fact of the matter is that the caps are here and they're presumably here to stay. So how does this change the landscape of how some of us heavy users utilize the Internet.</p>
<p>1. Say goodbye to open Wireless Access Points.&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; It only takes a warning letter that you've gone over your bandwidth before people who, either unknowingly or in the spirit of openess, leave their Wifi access points open to share with the community. Because you can be guaranteed some asshole out there won't stop pirating, but instead will just pirate using your service. Time to buy an EVDO card.</p>
<p>2.&Acirc;&nbsp; Internet Backups - Ah yes, the glory that is cloud computing. Storing your data in the cloud, backing things up in the cloud and all the fun shit that we used to talk about. Well I doubt people will be going that route for much longer. My Aperture library is 34gb in space and I'm a small time user compared to some. My iTunes library is almost 30 gig itself. Sure you've only got to back it up once. Let's just hope you don't backup and restore in the same month.</p>
<p>3.&Acirc;&nbsp; Digital Distribution - Alone digital distribution isn't really impacted, but combined with Internet Backups or another web intensive component and you could be close to hitting your bandwidth cap. I bought 2 episodes of HOUSE last night along with a download to check out Ubuntu. All totaled that was almost 2 gig right there. A far ways away from the 250gb, but that's today, on a work day.</p>
<p>4. Streaming Content - Again alone it doesn't make a dent. A lot of the usage numbers I see being reported are things like "That's over 4 standard definition movies a day". OK that's great, but watching movies is not all I do. Not to mention the Internet is my major source of television. So 8 hours of TV viewing (assuming each moviei is 2 hours long) is quite possible in a house where the occupants work two totally opposite shifts. (And one happens to be a TV/Web-aholic) Not to mention what happens to our good friend Slingbox? I don't have any info on it's digital footprint, but I'm sure streaming your television signal can eat things up quickly.</p>
<p>5. HD Digital Downloads - You'll notice that most of the stats are always compared to Standard Definition viewing instead of HD viewing.&Acirc;&nbsp; With that in mind HD TV shows could get too big to consider downloading. Porn watchers all over the world will also be disappointed. Because we all know porn watchers are typically excessive. Guess we'll need those BluRay players after all.</p>
<p>I'm not saying it's the end of the Internet as we know it. (Or at least Comcast isn't solely killing it)&Acirc;&nbsp; The bandwidth cap is quite large but will others follow suit? What bandwidth caps are other companies experimenting with? Time Warner is looking at a package of 40GB for $55 dollars per month. That makes Comcast look quite saintly doesn't it?</p>
<p>In a way we have ourselves to blame. Comcast never signed up to usher in a digital revolution. They signed up to make money. To grow for growth's sake. Who dictates that? We do. As stock holders. As 401K owners. Nobody wants stock that sits still. We demand that companies continue to grow revenue.&Acirc;&nbsp; An easy way to generate revenue is to control costs and believe me bandwidth isn't free. So considering they're not completely cutting us off at the knees with the cap limit, maybe their plans aren't as nefarious as people seem to think. Whatever there motives, I know one thing is clear.</p>
<p>Part of the Internet just died.</p>
