<p>Well it sounds like the boys at Cupertino are still in hot shit from the MobileMe debacle. I got this e-mail from Apple today.</p>
<blockquote><p>MobileMe Update</p>
<p>We have already made many improvements to MobileMe, but we still have many more to make. To recognize our users' patience, we are giving every MobileMe subscriber as of today a free 60 day extension. This is in addition to the one month extension most subscribers have already received. We are working very hard to make MobileMe a great service we can all be proud of. We know that MobileMe's launch has not been our finest hour, and we truly appreciate your patience as we turn this around. Read this article for more details.</p>
<p>The MobileMe Team</blockquote></p>
<p>So that's a total of 3 months free thanks to MobileMe not quite working the way it should be. Luckily I barely use the web services and that seems to be where most of the problems live. It's great the Apple is recognizing that they let us down and are trying to make good. But the bottom line is if you don't have an iPhone, all of the services provided by MobileMe could be cobbled together from free services. <br></p>
<p>That sounds like a good idea for a post. Free MobileMe. I'm on it!</p>
