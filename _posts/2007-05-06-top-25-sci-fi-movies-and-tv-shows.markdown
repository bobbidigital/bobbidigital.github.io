<p><img src="http://vanvogt.www4.mmedia.is/images/large/Astounding%20Science%20Fiction%20June%201947%20--%20Centaurus%20II.jpg" class="right" height="175" width="105">So if you don't know or haven't seen it, Entertainment Weekly did an article on the <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20036782_20037403_20037541,00.html">top 25 sci-fi</a> movies and television shows of the past 25 years. Now I don't know how these lists are generated. From the looks of things some 22 year old jack hole goes in a broom closet and comes up with something that is designed to maximize the number of pissed of sci-fi fans who read EW. I can't believe they put The Matrix as the number one Sci-Fi piece in the past 25 years. Are you fucking kidding me? It's good don't get me wrong, but number 1? In the past 25 <b>YEARS</b>?</p>
<p>So like true dorks, a bunch of us sat around the table and devised our own lists. The rules were simple. Jot down the top 25 films or tv shows of the past 25 years. (I believe 82 was our cutoff point) Each person ranks, then we tally the votes. Any title with the number 1 spot gets 25 points, titles at the 25 spot gets 1 point. You get the idea. Add them up between the four of us and our combined results are:</p>
<p>25. (Tie) Alien Nation & Tron<br />
24. 12 Monkey's<br />
23. The Last Starfighter<br />
22. Predator (Don't yell at me. Wasn't on my list)<br />
21. Fifth Element<br />
20. Stargate (The movie..not the shows)<br />
19. Quantum Leap<br />
18. Farscape<br />
17. Event Horizon<br />
16. Firefly<br />
15. Starship Troopers<br />
14. V: The miniseries<br />
13. The Thing<br />
12. Total Recall<br />
11. Dr. Who<br />
10. Aliens  (first one was out of the scope of the rules..sorry)<br />
09. Star Trek: The Wrath of Kahn<br />
08. The Matrix<br />
07. Dune<br />
06: Battlestar Galactica (new stuff..not the old funk-a-dunk)<br />
05. Terminator<br />
03 & 04 (Tied) Blade Runner and Return of the Jedi<br />
02. The X-files<br />
01. Star Trek: The Next Generation</p>
<p>Honorable Mentions going out to: ET, Johnny Mneumonic, The 4400, Futurama, Sliders, Back to the Future, Independence Day.  Expect to hear our debate on an upcoming podcast. That's right ATD the podcast is coming back. You heard it here first....because....this is where it would come out......</p>
