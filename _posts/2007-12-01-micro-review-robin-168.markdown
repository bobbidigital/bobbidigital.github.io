<p><img src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/images/Robin.jpg" style="float : left;" border="1" height="200" width="150">  Well I haven't read a Robin comic in awhile. Tim Drake just never really appealed to me all that much. But I was forced to pickup Robin #168 because in classic comic book fashion a series I want to read is spread across multiple books. Robin #168 kicks off "The Resurrection of Ra's Al Ghul" series. </p>
<p>Yes that's right, Ra's is back from the dead and he's looking for a new body. Not really sure how Ra's comes back, because the series starts with Ra's already on a boat headed for Gotham.....weird. But it seems he's after his grandson Damian to do some serious body snatching. For those who haven't been following, Damina is Batman's son. Yes his BatSemen finally struck home in the lovely Talia, Ra's daughter, and she bore Batman's first child.</p>
<p>The book starts the series and also highlights the tension between Damian and Tim Drake. All in all a kind of unexciting start in my opinion. But I've already got books 2, 3 and 4 which spread across Nightwing, Batman and Batman Detective Comics. So we'll see how it goes. While not thrilled, I'm curious enough to finish the 7 part series out.</p>
