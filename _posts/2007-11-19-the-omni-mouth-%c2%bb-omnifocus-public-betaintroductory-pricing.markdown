<p>For those GTD fans out there this is good news! Merlin Mann of&nbsp; 43 folders has been working with the boys over at OmniGroup.&nbsp; So you KNOW this thing should be THE tool. Looking forward to checking it out. My only problem is, I don't work with Macs on my day job. So I'll probably be sticking to one of the online variations of GTD. Or I'll switch jobs. </p>
