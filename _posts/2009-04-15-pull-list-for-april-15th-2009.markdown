  content: I'm a little behind but I did pick up all TPB of the Criminal series by
    Brubaker and Philips and damn is it hot. I am waiting for the trade of the last
    100 Bullets with baited breath however. DMZ, always a keeper. Also, The League
    of Extraordinary Gentlemen has the first issue of Volume 3 out. YES!!!
