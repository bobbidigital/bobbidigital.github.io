<p>Ummm...what? Am I reading this correctly? </p>
<blockquote><p>Lionsgate is gearing up a sequel to "Crank" titled "Crank 2: High Voltage" with Jason Statham set to reprise his role as hitman Chev Chelios. Variety reports that the first film's writers/directors, Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, will return for the sequel as well.</p>
<p>The sequel will reportedly take place after the events of the first film and will focus on a Chinese mobster who has stolen Chelios' nearly indestructible heart and replaced it with a battery-powered ticker that requires regular jolts of electricity to keep working.</blockquote></p>
<p>But...but....didn't he die? From like a plain that was 25,000 feet in the air? How are they pulling this one off?</p>
