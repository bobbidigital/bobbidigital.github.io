<p><img src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/images/panic.png" width="154" height="100" border="2" class="right">So I patched my iBook to version 10.4.9 not too long ago. The problem that I always run into however is that I never seem to reboot right away. I always wait a little while because I run Software Updater when I'm in the middle of 1000 things. (Silly me) Well this time it seriously bit me in the ass.</p>
<p>There is some bug during the prebinding process which is often masked as "Optimizing System Performance" after an install. So while I was doing 1000 other things, this prebinding bug was hit, but with no visual cue of trouble. Had I rebooted right away, I could have easily blamed the patch as the problem. But because I waited 3 days the memory gets a tad funny and you're never quite sure of the last thing you did.</p>
<p>So after the reboot, the machine basically wouldn't boot past the "Mac OS X" splash screen, where you would normally see a small progress bar and then the login screen. So I tried booting in verbose mode, not much help. Single user mode, also not much help. So I decided to boot clear the NVRAM. Well that was probably bad. Because after that I started getting a Kernel panic</p>
<p>So now I'm worse off than where I was. You get the dreaded "You need to restart your computer" error message in 5 different languages. So I did some research and found some kernel extension files I needed to delete. *GASP* I reboot in single user mode and got rid of the following files and directories.</p>
<ul>
<li>/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kernelcaches</li>
<li>/System/Library/Extensions.kextcache</li>
<li>/System/Library/Extensions.mkext</li>
<li>/Library/Caches/com.apple.ATS</li>
<li>In/Library/Caches, remove all the com.apple.LaunchServices files.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>After removing those files and rebooting I was at least back where I started. I then read somewhere that it could have been part of the patch and re-installing the patch would help. But if the machine is dead, how can I reinstall it? Hmmm.. That's where target mode came in. I hooked my iBook up to my G5 and booted the iBook in Firewire disk mode. Then from the G5 I downloaded the patch, reinstalled it onto the iBooks hard disk and voila. Life was better. </p>
<p>Turns out that the bug is actually a missing Library file. So the login screen is in fact crashing over and over again behind the Mac OS X splash screen. Cool huh? </p>
