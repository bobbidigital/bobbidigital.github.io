  content: the proposed AT&amp;T and BellSouth merger has a clause that says they
    have to adhere to Net Neutrality standards for two years. two years!? that's nothing!
    Net Neutrality is a big deal. i suppose the free internet can't last forever,
    but it will be a sad, sad day when it's gone for good. people don't realize how
    good a thing they have right now. soon, we'll be looking back to these 'good ol'
    days' when the internet was like the wild west and not like your cable service.

(Or roughly 13.3 gigabytes per second. 8 bits to a byte) You must live on Mars if you don't realize what a tremendous boost in capability this will provide us with for the Internet. But it goes beyond video gaming and quicker downloads of your pirated Windows Vista install. It means the Internet will continue to survive. That's right, I said it. Siemens and other tech companies know that without an innovation like this, the Internet could croak.</p>
<p>Think of the advancements over the past few years and what the Internet has brought to us. Streaming video, streaming music, photos and HUGE file transfers of all sorts of pirated goodness. And while individual providers are currently capable of handling such traffic, what about the Internet's backbone? Is it up for the challenge of increased usage of video and music? Will the advent of HD video create another set of problems for these backbones of the Internet?</p>
<p>I guess the first question is, who owns the backbone? It's been widely debated that the Internet belongs to nobody. It is its very own self-regulating entity. But anyone who reads or watches science fiction and or plays Shadowrun knows that nothing governs itself. The major players are AT&T, Qwest, Level 3 and Sprint Nextel. Of course the cable companies have a piece of the action as well as a host of smaller telecommunications companies but the big ones are listed.</p>
<p>How long do these giants of the Internet decide that they're going to deal with rising costs on their end for handling all this traffic? Not long at all. Enter the net neutrality act. But without an innovation like the one Siemens is working on, how long is it truly before the Internet that we know and love collapses in on itself? And what would the world be like? I would imagine that many of us have forgotten how to be social, how to interact face to face. I hate dealing with bank tellers, so I do everything online. I can't remember to pay my bills on time. So I have my computer do it for me. And what if our innovations, our Web 2.0's, what if they killed the very thing we were looking to enhance?</p>
<p>Good luck Siemens. I think this means more to us than most of us realize.<br />
