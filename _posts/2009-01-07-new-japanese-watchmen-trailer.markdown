<p>The latest trailer for the most anticipated GN adaptation ever is from the Japanese and it just makes me want March to get here tomorrow.</p>
<p>For those unaware of this quintessential GN written by comics-god Alan Moore, illustrated by Dave Gibbons, and colored by John Higgins,&Acirc;&nbsp; it takes place during 1985 in an alternate universe where masked crusaders are banned, a real superman exists, and Nixon is still President.&Acirc;&nbsp; On the brink of a world war, an older masked crusader is killed and Rorschach, a masked crusader/vigilante who opposes the Keene Act which banned the heroes, investigates the murder only to uncover the most Byzantinian plot to ever be conceived for the comics medium. If you haven't read Watchmen, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy from the library. For real buffs and collectors, the Absolute Watchmen is boss (yes, I do have a copy) with it's oversized, recolored pages and slipcase. Drooooooooooool.</p>
