  content: "Hi Jeff, it's kind of an intriguing idea, but wonder if it would work.\r\n\r\nBlockbuster
    has a lot of great locations and a great brand. Circuit City used to have loyal
    customers and employees, but has managed to totally turn off both groups.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    it could work, but Circuit City is probably a sinking ship. After years of prudent
    management, they've made a string of the worst decisions imaginable.\r\n\r\nGetting
    rid of appliances was one. I used to always be in there just for that, it was
    low margin but it brought customers back. Lowe's has profited tremendously from
    that dumb decision.\r\n\r\nTHEN they fire all the \"high\"-paid employees. Might
    as well put up a sign, \"Only stupid people apply to work here\", because they've
    made it plain that they have no interest in giving anyone much of a raise.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure why Blockbuster needs Circuit City; maybe they're just buying it for
    quick access to the vendor supply chain.\r\n\r\nOne thing: Unlike CC, BB understands
    about getting customers in the store often, and that heavy traffic might do a
    lot to help sell glitzy electronics. Every time you go in for a video, etc., you'll
    see that cute gizmo you've been thinking about buying :)"

  content: "OK, I can connect with the idea of feeding into the impulse buy.  As long
    as they don't pull the old tourist attraction bit where you have to walk through
    the electronics department to rent a movie. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure what Blockbuster's
    relationship is with customers. I personally don't care for Blockbuster much as
    I've had several bad customer service experiences. I don't know how other people
    feel about them, but if they can forge a relationship with customers who come
    in on a regular basis for videos than I can at least see the logic behind the
    deal. \r\n\r\nBut for them to say it's a game changing retail concept?  Or to
    compare themselves with the Apple store? Sounds kind of silly to me =)  But you've
    at least got me following their strategy."

<blockquote><p>Movie rental house Blockbuster has made an unsolicited takeover bid for struggling electronics retailer Circuit City, a move that aims to combine the stores of both companies into "a game-changing retail concept" akin to Apple Inc.'s widely successful international retail operation. </blockquote></p>
<p>Can someone explain to me how this marks a "game-changing retail concept". I know that sounds snarky, but I'd really be interested in what in this deal makes a game changing concept, or how they could even consider comparing themselves to Apple's retail stores. </p>
<p>I guess the biggest difference between the two is that even with this merger, the new Blockbuster & Circuit City will lack one integral thing. There own content. Both houses rely on content from others and therefore become nothing more than glorified flea markets. </p>
<p>Right? Am I missing something?	</p>
