<p>Without being able to negotiate a new deal, Apple was forced to pull the remainder of its NBC programming off the iTunes Music Store. Pirates around the world let out a loud sigh, knowing that now they'll also have to pirate episodes of The Office.</p>
<p>I purchased almost 2 full seasons of The Office off the iTunes store. I've purchased many episodes of Heroes Season 1 from the iTunes store. Since this season began I've looked for episodes of Journeyman, Bionic Woman, Heroes and Life on the iTunes store. The catch is, I'm not going to find another avenue to watch these shoes. I'm simply not going to watch them. (Except The Office...i'll Netflix that) Why? Because TV just isn't as engaging to me to have to put forth any REAL effort to watch it. The iTunes store combined with Apple TV gave me a certain ease of use that allowed me to watch things I normally wouldn't really even bother with. I know many people are thinking "Well Hulu is coming and it'll be awesome." </p>
<p>Hulu will remind me of what I leave in the bowl every morning before I catch the bus. Who in God's name really WANTS to watch TV on their computer screen? I know people do it, but it's not a choice, it's a lack of options. The television experience still belongs .....you guessed it..on the TV! Even with a beautiful screen like the iPhone, it takes are a really engaging show for me to be able to watch 45 minutes in my hand. I like quick shows like <a href="www.mobuzz.com">Mobuzz TV</a> or like how G4TV splits their shows up into little 5 or 8 minute segments. That's about as much of one show on a hand held device that I can take. So still there is no real substitute for television.</p>
<p>So thank you NBC for porking me, which in turn is porking you. Is it piracy if I download it with the commercials still in it?</p>
