An e-mail from a UI member Craig Cantello. I had no idea he was actually into the whole tech scene, but low and behold he's actually putting on a tech event. He's putting one together in the area where I live. I can't begin to tell you how excited I am about this. I mean we are Tech Valley right? So where the hell is the tech?</p>
<p>It appears to be an all day event starting around 10am running until almost 6pm. If you're around or might be interested definitely check it out. If we don't show up in force, no telling when there might be another one.</p>
