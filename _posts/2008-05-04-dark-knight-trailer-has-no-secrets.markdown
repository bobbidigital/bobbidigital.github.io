<p>A few boards have been going ape-shit over this image from The Dark Knight trailer.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/9826-blog.png" alt="9826_blog.png" border="0" width="400" height="170" /></p>
<p>If you're like me your wondering what the hub-bub is about. Look closely.  You'll notice that Harvey Dent's face is burned on one half of it. Why this is so exciting though I have no idea. </p>
<p>SPOILER ALERT: Harvey Dent is Two-Face. *GASP*</p>
