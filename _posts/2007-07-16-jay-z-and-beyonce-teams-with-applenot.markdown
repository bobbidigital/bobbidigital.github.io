<p>I've heard the rumor several times that Jay-Z and Beyonce are teaming up with Apple to create a record label. This has got to be some type of joke. Not sure how these things get started but if I remember correctly the Beatles were suing Apple for trademark infringement not too many years ago. (I think the Beatles had a record company or  something called Apple) </p>
<p>Part of that settlement was that Apple would NOT enter the music business. I remember there was some controversy when iTunes popped up, but it was ruled that Apple was not actually producing music, just serving as a distributor. If they were to partner up with Jay-Z and Beyonce I'm almost certain that would violate their previous deal in regards to the Beatles case. </p>
<p>Sorry, but I don't see this one happening.</p>
