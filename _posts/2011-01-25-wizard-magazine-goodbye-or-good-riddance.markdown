<p>The comic book world was shocked and dismayed yesterday when the news broke that <a href="http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/01/24/wizard-magazine-to-close-immediately/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed:+BleedingCool+(Bleeding+Cool+Comic+News+%26+Rumors)&utm_content=Twitter">Wizard Magazine would be closing</a> up immediately. The reaction was typical to our nerd community. Comic book lovers and science fiction fans tend to live in the land of nostalgia rather than the harsh reality of an ever changing world. I too was extremely disappointed at the news. I even went home to go through my old Wizard magazines so that I could silently reflect on this tragic loss. Then it occurred to me that I haven't bought a Wizard Magazine in over 2 years. When I did actually subscribe, it was only to get a 10% discount on a purchase I made at Best Buy.</p>
<p>Nerds have a hard time accepting change. So often the value of a good or service is tied to our memories and experiences with it, rather than the practicalities and place that it holds in the coming age. In comic book land, the situation is even worse. We hold our experiences as sacrosanct, feeling that the way were exposed to the medium is the best way to remain relevant. But that approach did not fair well for the music industry, the movie industry or the newspaper industry and it won't hold well for the comic book industry either. </p>
<p>The closing of the magazine shows me that the comic book industry is growing up and is capable of making tough decisions for the viability of the business, not just to appease basement dwelling fanboys. To make a decision like this is probably more difficult in comics, where the business operators are also die-hard fans of the medium. The management team has also decided to take <a href="http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/01/24/wizard-world-inc-goes-public/">Wizard World Inc public</a>, a move that should provide additional funding for the ever popular Comic Con. These conventions have become a staple not just in the comic book industry, but the entertainment scene as a whole. A digital magazine is also in the works, although I question the quality of the magazine considering they laid off most of the magazine's writing staff. (Maybe they only ditched the chum)</p>
<p>It's true, a piece of comic book history has died. But this industry will thrive or dwindle based on its efficiency in the new digital age. The actual print version of comic books also has its days numbered. But do you love the medium or do you love your memories of it? Did music suddenly change because we went from vinyl to cd's to MP3s? The acquisition is different, but the core of the experience is the same. The communities are different, but rest assured new communities have emerged.  As nerds we need to divorce ourselves from the romanticized images of the past. Today is here and it's a lot different than yesterday.</p>
