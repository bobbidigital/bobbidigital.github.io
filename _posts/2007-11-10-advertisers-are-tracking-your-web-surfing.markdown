<p>And who gives a shit? No really people, someone answer me why everyone<br />
gets so up in arms when they find out that advertisers are tracking your web surfing?</p>
<p>The reality of the situation is simple. You will always have ads. And you want to always have ads. Why? Because the Google Reader app your using to read this, the mozilla firefox browser your using, the boards you surf to talk about Heroes? Guess how they're all supported? That's right people ADS! And all of the Web 2.0 folks are going to say "Yeah, but we the industry needs to change to match with the times!" Yeah, that's exactly what they're trying to do. They're trying to evolve and target ads you specifically want. Isn't that what "new media" is supposed to be all about? Getting to the content YOU care about? No, the reality is we want what we want, when we want, how we want it and we don't want to be subject to any form of inconvenience. (Oh yeah free doesn't hurt either) So it's odd that I hear these rants from podcasters and vidcasters and then moments after they cut for a "thank you" plug from their "sponsor". Sounds like advertising to me.</p>
<p>So now that we've established that you actually WANT ads, lets explain why you WANT websites to track your usage. You're going to get the ads either way you cut it. (And you want them) So wouldn't you rather have ads that are related to something you may actually WANT to purchase? I'm a 29 year old amateur photographer. I would rather get an advertisement about the new Nikon cameras than Viagra. </p>
<p>So with this bit of logic can someone explain to me why we're so paranoid about being tracked? Because its an invasion of privacy? Yeah right! We use things like Twitter and Jaiku to advertise where we are and what we're doing. We use services like Flickr to give a photojournalism aspect to our lives. We write blogs that are nothing more than a cry to say "please look at me, I'm important too!" (at least that's why I do it) Del.icio.us is our way of sharing with the world what sites we think are cool! So with all this openness advertisers are some how crossing the line?</p>
<p>It sounds to me that a lot of people are ashamed of the surfing they do. People might buy that you're randomly being served a viagra ad. But that same excuse might not fall for your "Dolphins humping cabbage patch kids while David Hassleholf watches and yanks himself" videos. </p>
<p>If your worried about advertisers tracking you, then chances are you're Googling some sick shit.</p>
