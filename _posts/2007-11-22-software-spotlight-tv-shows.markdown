Or even worse if you don't HAVE a Tivo and you're just not good with being home on time. Or even worse...you get the idea.</p>
<p>A lot of us use BitTorrent to download our TV shows. I'm not here to argue the legality of such acts nor am I promoting it. Well actually I guess I am because I'm about to tell you an easier way to do it.</p>
<p>You need to check out a little application called <a href="http://tvshows.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">TV Shows</a>. What <a href="http://tvshows.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">TV Shows</a> does is it subscribes you to a particular television series for downloading when particular episodes become available.  The interface is easy. Just search for your show, click subscribe and BOOM. When the show becomes available it will download it using your default bittorrent application.</p>
<p>The nice thing about this app is that it runs as a daemon process (like a windows service) so you don't even have to remember to launch it. I installed it on a trial basis awhile ago and had totally forgotten about it.  Then one day I go into my movies folder and I see all these episodes of Heroes from the 2nd season! Awesome!</p>
<p>The application has an update feature too so as new shows become available they get put into the search list. Nice..very nice.</p>
<p>Now for the bad part for some of you. This app is Mac only. Check it out at the sourceforge site <a href="http://tvshows.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
