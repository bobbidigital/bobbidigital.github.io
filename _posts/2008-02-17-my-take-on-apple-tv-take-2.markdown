<p>My Take on Apple Take 2</p>

So, late last week I finally got around to updating my Apple TV (80 hour work weeks mess up your priorities). I sat down and navigated with my remote to the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Update Software&acirc;&euro;¬ù option. After a couple of clicks confirming my intent, the download was off and running. It took about 15 minutes to download on my consistently crummy DSL connection. Two reboots later, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m presented with a new montage video for Apple TV and then I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m staring at Apple TV Take 2. (Plus, my wallet hasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t been violated yet. Thank you, Steve.)</p>
<p>Like most human beings, change makes me a bit nervous. So, when I see their new floating pane interface my heart suddenly skipped a beat. While the look is different the menu system is (mostly) logical and easy to navigate. You can quickly surmise that the intent was to make it feel as if your library was truly the breadth of the iTunes Store catalog. Movies that are part of the Apple Store are neatly nested within your options of Movies, TV Shows, and Podcasts. Another positive change: now there is no separation (menu wise) between what is in your personal iTunes Library and what is currently synced to your Apple TV. As long as iTunes is running on the host machine, you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll see the full catalog of your iTunes library without having to switch into some other menu screen. However, this only happens with the machine that Apple TV is synced with. Other shared libraries are still accessed separately through a menu interface. I think that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s something I can live with.</p>
<p>The next thing I HAD to do was visit the iTunes Store from my television. I was bursting with excitement when I clicked the Top Movies menu option and saw some of my recent favorite films pop up. By clicking on them I was able to watch a small 30 second preview as well as a write-up on the film. You&acirc;&euro;&trade;re able to search through the iTunes Store by their top movies, which I believe is ranked by downloads, genres, HD or a text search. The text search will default to title, but will also suggest actors and or directors as your search term begins to get qualified.</p>
<p>Of course, being the tech-geek that I am, I had to rush to the all HD section of the store to begin downloading. I browsed through the catalog and was a little surprised by the HD content. Some of the movies were recent, such as NEXT with Nicholas Cage, but some were not so recent, such as Superfly starring Ron O&acirc;&euro;&trade;Neal. The lineup of HD is simply perplexing. It's as if Apple sent a memo to its employees asking everyone to bring in the movies they own that are distributed through their partnered studios. Nevertheless, I found Mr. Brooks in HD and rented it at the $4.99 premium for HD content. (Regular movies rent for $3.99)</p>
<p>This review is a little late, so I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m sure that most of you are familiar with the terms of the rental. Standard definition movies are $3.99, HD movies are $4.99 and you get 30 days to start watching the movie and only 24 hours to finish it once you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve started. After the 24 hours the content expires and magically disappears from your Apple TV. As a result of this agreement, I was too afraid to begin watching the movie immediately; I let it quietly download in the background until the next day.</p>
<p>Having this content restriction really does make you observe when you start the movie. Is it too late? Will I fall asleep? Do I have something to do in 2 hours? Will it be too close? These are frequent questions I asked myself every time I sat down to watch Mr. Brooks. It was incredibly more annoying than I originally thought it would be. This Saturday night I finally broke free, sat down and watched it. (Excellent movie by the way)</p>
<p>First, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll talk a little bit about the quality of the content. The sound quality was excellent and I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m elated to see that Apple TV is finally taking advantage of it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s ability to do Dolby 5.1 sound. For the average consumer (not you audiophiles) the sound will be more than adequate and should sound crisp coming out of your home theater system. (I have a BOSE system.) The video quality is also excellent, but should not be allowed to carry the moniker HD. I know what the stats on the video and the codec might say, but this film was more HD-ish than HD. If you were to walk into my apartment and see the film, you&acirc;&euro;&trade;d think it looks great for a digital copy, but would never guess that it was HD. As you may or may not know, there are many different variables that go into final image quality when dealing with HD, so I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll have to do a follow up article with a different movie. Perhaps NEXT would be a better candidate for the HD review.</p>
<p>The one drawback of renting movies from the comfort of your couch is the fact that movies don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t sync back to your Mac or PC. So, if you rent a movie from the Apple TV it's not transferable to your other media devices such as the iPhone or iPod; yet, if you rent the movie from your Mac or PC  you can transfer it to your Apple TV. Another flaw would be the samples provided for movies. Apple hasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t taken any real care in the preview area of the iTunes Store. A random 30 second sample is selected, so you could be looking at the closing credits or you could be looking at a meaningless exchange between two inconsequential characters. The preview almost seems as if it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s more for previewing quality than it is the actual content of the movie.</p>
<p>After almost two years of banishment to the upgrade abyss, I think the enhancements to the Apple TV are a big bonus. It has added a new level of richness to the experience of Internet delivered viewing. Other features that I didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t get into are: You Tube viewing from Apple TV, Flickr photo viewing from Apple TV, and the ability to navigate iTunes registered podcasts from Apple TV. These 3 user generated content additions takes us one step closer to truly independent media being delivered to users in an easy and efficient manor. While it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not perfect, I truly believe it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the best solution on the market for the average consumer. I personally can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t wait until Take 3.</p>
