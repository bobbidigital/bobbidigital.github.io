<blockquote><p>There is no information on how large the role of Amanda will be in the "Trek" movie. Given that Ryder, 36, is only six years older than Zachary Quinto, who plays her son, suggests that either she will be made up to appear older, or perhaps she will be seen in a flashback.</blockquote></p>
<p>The last word in that quote from the article just pisses me off. Why does Star Trek have such a hard time staying in one time space? Even when we go back ot the Original Series timeline we still have to flashback? What the fuck?</p>

<p>p.s. OK, I found the picture of Winona after I wrote the post. If she looks like that in the show she can play Kirk for all I care. DAYUM!
