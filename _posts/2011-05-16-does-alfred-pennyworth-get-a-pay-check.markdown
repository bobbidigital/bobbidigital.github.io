<p><img src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/images/alfred401k.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 4px 4px 4px 4px; height: 205px; width: 265px;" />I was at my monthly <a href="http://www.meetup.com/comicschicago/">Chicago Comic Book Meetup</a> and we started an interesting conversation about dysfunctional families in comics. The discussion finally made its way to the relationship between Alfred and Bruce Wayne. While their relationship obviously goes beyond master and butler, there still exists a certain rigidness about it. Alfred still refers to him as Master Bruce or Master Wayne. Someone at the meetup made the comment that despite the closeness of their relationship, Alfred would always adhere to his position in society in relation to Bruce Wayne.</p>
<p>But hasn't their relationship become more like family? (Even though it's not reflected in their addresses to one another.) So the idea of Alfred getting a weekly pay check from the Wayne Foundation for his service as a butler just seems odd to me.  I'm sure it has never come up in conversations at DC, but I can't imagine Alfred getting a regular direct deposit pay check. Sure he's compensated, but I would imagine that just about anything and everything he does, goes on the black Visa card. Can you imagine Alfred "saving up" for a new flat screen television. I'm not sure what butlers make, but my guess is that it's not baller status. But at the same time, I couldn't imagine Bruce letting Alfred want for anything.</p>
<p>Here's another angle. If Alfred gets paid like any other commoner, what happens if Bruce goes broke? Does Alfred move out and get another job? Does he work a register during the day and help Batman solve crimes at night? I think not. They'd be broke, in squalor together, trying to figure a way out of things. I've had some terrific bosses, but I'd never stick around for no pay if our relationship hadn't somehow transcended employer/employee.</p>
<p>Here are a few things that regular employees would have to go through, that I can't imagine Alfred ever dealing with.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pitching into his 401k plan</li>
<li>Going through a performance appraisal</li>
<li>Filing an expense report</li>
<li>Getting a Purchase Order approved</li>
<li>Choosing between an HMO and a PPO</li>
<li>Missing the family reunion because gas rates are so high</li><br />
 </ul>    </p>
<p>The list is silly, but at the same time incredibly serious. When Alfred starts to collect a paycheck, it brings into focus the everyday problems that must come along with that. It also makes us separate what Alfred has and what Bruce Wayne has, which for years has been one in the same to me.</p>
<p>Do you think Alfred Pennyworth collects a pay check? Why or why not?</p>
