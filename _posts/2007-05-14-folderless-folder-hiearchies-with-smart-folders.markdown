<p><img src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/images/smartfolder.gif" height="100" width="154" border="2" class="left">So lets not be coy, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m an apple fan boy. Have been ever since I switched. But there are two applications, which I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve been very very pleased with. Those apps are Aperture and iTunes. The things I like best about both of these applications are that they handle all of the file and folder hierarchy structures.</p>
<p>I hate attempting to organize folders. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m never really good at deciding where things belong or where they should go. My primary goal has been to over simplify everything. I use broad categories to classify things such as music genres, project names so on and so forth. </p>
<p>My biggest problem is that so many things crossover and can be classified different ways for me. For example I might have a manual on a particular topic. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d want to file this under both my manual folder and the folder that has that topic.  Keeping two copies of the folder is a horrible idea. Thankfully Unix offers us another alternative in Symbolic links. Symbolic links allow us to create references to a file from another location. This has been used on Unix systems for quite sometime, but there might be a better solution.</p>
<p>Smart folders allow us to create saved searches and use them as folders.  The types of info you can create smart folders on are almost endless.</p>
<ul>
<li> File Sizes </li>
<li> Create Dates</li>
<li> File Names</li>
<li> Labels</li>
<li> Last Opened Date</li>
<li> Kind of File</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>The list goes on and on, but I think you get the idea. My favorite thing to use though is the spotlight comments. I combine this with the tagging features in Quicksilver and so far it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s been a fair solution.</p>
<p>Quicksilver allows you to add metatags to files in the spotlight comments section of a file. Basically whatever tag you add gets appended in the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Spotlight Comments&acirc;&euro; section of the metadata as &acirc;&euro;&oelig;@&acirc;&euro; + whatever the file name is. You can add multiple tags to the same file to solve my problem of one file in two locations. Then I simply create smart folders that are based on the appropriate metatags. With this process I never have to worry about where a file lives on my hard disk. I just put everything into my Documents folder and let the smart folders do the rest.</p>
<p>This is probably the most simplistic usage of smart folders. If any of you out there use Smart Folders, please drop me a line or a comment and let me know what you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re doing.</p>
