I'm a little late in posting this, but better late than never. The [panel that I moderated](http://www.allthingsdork.com/2014/04/18/C2E2-is-Almost-Here/) for C2E2 finally has video footage up. It was a great discussion with a bunch of really great people. [Scott Snyder](https://twitter.com/Ssnyder1835) was so incredibly humble and gracious. He's lucky I hadn't started reading [Batman Eternal](https://www.comixology.com/Batman-Eternal-2014-1/digital-comic/88480) before the panel. I'm so in love with that book I'm not sure I could have prevented myself from bear-hugging him.  Anyways, I digress. Check out this great talk.
