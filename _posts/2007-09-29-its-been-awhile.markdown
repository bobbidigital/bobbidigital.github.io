  content: "Ouch! So I guess the job was the reason to move to Chicago, but you all
    decided you like it anyway and are going to stay?\r\n\r\nI haven't really been
    there, just the airport, but it seems like all I ever hear about it are either
    real strong positives or real strong negatives. Hopefully you guys will get to
    enjoy the positives of living in Chicago, and the bumpy start will soon be all
    in the past.\r\n\r\nGood luck,\r\nGordon"

<p>You have no idea the hell that life has been. I'm in Chicago. I got laid off in my 3rd day on the job. I didn't go into it much on here, but the job also included housing. So 3 days after being in Illinois, I'm jobless and homeless. Try telling THAT to your lady.</p>
<p>But we're finally getting settled. We lived in a hotel for awhile while we found work and then ultimately decided where we want to live. We decided we love the Chicagoland area and decided to move into the city. (That's the other thing..the job was in a suburb, not the actual city. So was the housing) So far we're both much happier than what we came to. The townhouse was BEAUTIFUL, but it wasn't ours you know? Not sure how comfortable we could have gotten in it.</p>
<p>So I'm working and I LOVE my job. LOVE my apartment (moved in 2 days ago). Soon I'll have Internet and what not back so the posts will continue. I'm actually going to bring on my buddy Nate to help with some writing. Until then, enjoy this little gem my friend discovered on the true origins of The Assassination of Lincoln.</p>
