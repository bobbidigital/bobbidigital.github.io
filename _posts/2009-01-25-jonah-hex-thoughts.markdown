This was my first experience with the book after Blair Butler repeatedly recommended it on her show <a href="http://g4tv.com/attackoftheshow/blog/tag/72/Fresh_Ink.html">Fresh Ink</a>. I was a bit displeased with the issue, but luckily this is a problem with the issue and not with the series.</p>
<p>A brief recap for those that don't know, Jonah Hex is a comic book series set in the old west. Our hero Jonah is a bounty hunter trying to make a living in the vile, cut-throat setting of the wild west. The nice thing about the Hex book is that each issue is a self-contained story. There are no story arcs that carry from book to book which makes it easy to pick up and get into. I unfortunately just had bad luck of the draw.</p>
<p>Issue number 39 rubbed me the wrong way for two reasons. The color palette used and the imagery chosen to support the story. The color palette has very earthy tones. Some panels seem to be made up of nothing but different shades of brown, which does evoke a certain mood but doesn't make it appealing to sit and read. The muddiness of each frame makes the image difficult to decipher what the action is and who the characters are. I want to stress that it's not the artwork that's unappealing but the coloring used. The work seems to be well drawn but like most things in life the final product is all that matters. If the pieces don't gel together then the merits of individual components can be lost in the noise.</p>
<p>The other issue, also linked to the artwork, is the actual panels drawn to support the action. Not the quality of the action, but just the action chosen to be on display. I read this issue twice and didn't realize that was the problem until I went back and read issue number 38. (Which was stellar by the way) If you compare the two the first thing you'll notice is how much tighter the cohesion is between dialogue and imagery. Issue number 39 misses wide right of the mark set by number 38.  The artwork in a lot of panels paints a very unclear picture. This point is driven home in the last page when the cowardly sheriff does something that merits the respect of Jonah Hex and the patrons of the bar. What that action is I have no idea because the panel was unclear and there was no dialogue or caption boxes. You're left entirely to the artist's attempt at storytelling. Its failure is the final exclamation point on what made the book a disappointment. Not knowing the workflow between these particular collaborators I can't place blame on the writer or the artist. Instead I'll blame the editor because ultimately that's where the buck stops.</p>
<p>So the point of this post is to redact some of my comments made on the show. Based on a previous issue that I read I can see why people are going batshit crazy for Jonah Hex. I'll keep an eye on future issues for sure, but for those who may have heard the show and decided not to jump in I say to you skip issue 39. But hop in at 40 or maybe even 38 for some good times. More to come as more issues come out but I think this will be on my subscription list now.</p>
