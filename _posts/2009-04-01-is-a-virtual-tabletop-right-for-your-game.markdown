  content: "Hi, Trevor from RPTools here, I enjoyed reading your article, that's an
    exciting step to move to a VT.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, did you try out MapTool
    in your investigations ?  If so, I'd love to hear what turned you off of it, it's
    great to know what we need to improve.\r\n\r\nIf you hadn't had a chance yet,
    here is a recent forum post where someone asks 'Why should I use MapTool' http://forums.rptools.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=7874\r\n\r\nAnd
    here are a couple video tutorials that can give you an idea of what MapTool is
    about: http://rptoolstutorials.net/\r\n\r\nIf you want to tinker with
    it, you can launch it directly from the web (if you have Java installed) at http://www.rptools.net/index.php?page=launch
    (use the development 1.3b54, it's just about ready to be released as the official
    version)\r\n\r\nMapTool is entirely free, and is heavily community driven.  Two
    features that I think MT can add to your Pros list is \"advanced light and sight
    (including line of sight)\" and \"infinitely sized battle field (there aren't
    any limitations on the size of the battlemat)\"\r\n\r\nFeel free to email me any
    questions you may have.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time !\r\n-Trev"

<p><a href="img src="></a><img style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 3px; margin-right: 3px; border: 0px initial initial;" src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/battlegrounds.jpg" border="0" alt="Battlegrounds.jpg" width="367" height="277" align="left" />Everything in my life is pretty much digital. I've abandoned the pen and the pad for the iPhone notes program and my laptop. We were playing pen and paper D&amp;D one day and it occurred to me how much was missing from the game, as we moved figures across a boringly brown mat. I drew some horrible circle that was supposed to represent a tree, and another rectangle to represent a lake of fire.</p>
<p>Imagination is good, but it can only take you so far. I decided that maybe we should try out one of those virtual table tops that I keep hearing about. It's basically a battle mat on the computer. I floated it to the group and they were all in agreement with at least trying it out. So far we've had mixed results, but it has showed some promise.</p>
<p>Our first hurdle was to find something that was cross-platform. Not everyone in my group is wise enough to own a Mac, so compatability was key. We also didn't want the system to enforce a set of rules on us. We really just wanted it to be a battle mat and nothing more. We finally settled on a program called <a href="http://www.battlegroundsgames.com/">Battlegrounds</a>. The application met our two major requirements and was fairly inexpensive.</p>
<p>This is less of a review on the actual application and more just talking about the pros and cons of a virtual table top. A review of the specific application will come at a later date when we've got some more hours on it.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can visualize the entire battle scene and put all the little details into it that you want</li>
<li>Prepare your encounters ahead of time, leading to a lot less setup time per encounter</li>
<li>You can have your monsters look <strong>JUST</strong> like the monsters they're fighting by looking for some JPEG images</li>
<li>As a DM, you can easily hide and track monsters, keeping them invisible from other players</li>
<li>The players now have an easy method for communicating without the GM seeing or knowing. This works vice versa for the GM as well.</li>
<li>Your players don't actually have to physically be there if you need to play in a pinch or if you've moved away from your gaming group</li><br />
</ul><br />
<strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It's another distraction at the table</li>
<li>Technical issues can REALLY disrupt the game. A kitchen table never performs illegal memory operations</li>
<li>Less space at the table. People have some pretty big laptops these days</li>
<li>Is your group computer literate? I'm lucky in that mine is, but if yours isn't, be very careful</li>
<li>There is an upfront cost associated with it, purchasing the software and making sure everyone has a computer. If not you can get a projector or big monitor for everyone to see and use</li><br />
</ul><br />
I think these basic pros and cons hold true for all virtual tabletop systems. Of course some will perform better than others, but a lot of the things I've talked about our specifically people or spacial issues. I must say though I'm excited about the types of encounters I can create now, bringing them fully to life. There is a vibrant community out there who are building maps, building character avatars and helping each other.</p>
<p>This is technically our first time using the tool. Our first attempt was marred with technical issues, but the software's creator was very helpful and responsive. So we'll know a little bit more in the next couple of weeks. Stay tuned for more info.</p>
