  content: "You'll be interested to know that Ticket to Ride is also on the XBox and
    I hear has been ported over very well.\r\n\r\nWe were also at a Con last weekend
    and we found that quite a few people had heard about Carc. from XBox. So I think,
    instead of destroying the industry, it's actually a net positive."

<p>I'm a big board game fan, always have been and always will be. I love sitting down at a table and moving little pieces around and kicking ass, I'm a simply guy to please. Board games have been 'ported' to computers for as long as they've been around. Most of the time it's simple mainstream games like Monopoly and Scrabble, but quite a few more hardcore games have made it to the PC like Axis and Allies, Risk, Advanced Squad Leader and quite a few Warhammer games. The biggest problem I've had with board games on the PC was not being able to easily play with other people. Yes there were multi-player functions, but most of the time you had to actually know someone with the SAME patched version as you (a problem I ran into trying to play Civ IV with Nic a week ago) and then convince them to sit down and play. Then came the Xbox 360. </p>
<p>I used to be a huge PC game fan and hate console systems. I could get free games for the PC just by looking hard enough (Warez FTW), PC's were upgradeable and they could do so much more. Then I grew up and got a job. I got tired of constantly getting new drivers and new patches when I got a game and then still finding out my graphics card wasn't compatible. Then Jeff convinced me the Xbox was the best shit since sliced bread. How do I know if the game will run, if my graphics card is good, do I have enough Ram? That shit says Xbox on the front, right? It'll run! As long as I'm connected to the interweb it'll download patches for me, I don't even have to go looking for them. What's even better is a whole shitload of people playing the same game, with the same patches on Xbox Live. I don't even have to LOOK for them. So I've been sold on console gaming for awhile now. </p>
<p>So what happens when you combine board games with Xbox Live? Nate gets very happy! Recently I discovered the Xbox Arcade has Carcassonne and Settlers of Catan, two of my favorite board games. I'm so fond of them I've spent over $200 for Settlers and expansions and over $100 on Carcassonne. I was pleased to find out that I could buy them on Xbox Live for 800 points each. Now Microsoft's whole scheme with points should be criminal but that's another story. So, on to some reviews.</p>
<p>Carcassonne: The graphics are booty... Straight out of 1995 VGA graphics. Why am I playing with 10 year old graphics on an HD system? I'm not asking for super animated shit, hows about some crisp lines though? The tiles look like my 7 year old cut them out. Thats about my only complaint though! The game play is great! the interface is simple, but not very fancy. It takes a tiny bit of getting used to flipping the tiles around but thankfully they only let you put it in valid spots. The game is just as fast paced and enjoyable as the real thing. All of the same strategies are there, when to place farmers, how to mess with your opponents, betting on getting the one tile you need to complete something. There's even a pretty good tutorial for anyone who hasn't played yet. They have the River expansion and a King and Robbers expansion and supposedly are planning on releasing more of the expansions in the future. </p>
<p>Catan:<br />
Same poop graphics, although there is a graphics expansion that improves this AND animates the tiles, but who wants to spend another couple hundred points on it? The game play is good, the AI's are OK and most of the time make good decisions. I've played almost 20 games so far and have rarely had a problem finding 3 other people to play with. My biggest complaint is the lack of expansions. I own both Seafarers of Catan and the Knights and Cities expansions and find that that with the two expansions the game has a much higher replay value to it. Where as the expansions for Carcassonne add a little, Catan is far inferior game without them. This still doesn't stop me from playing non-stop, but it does make me want to get together with some guys and play the real deal. </p>
<p>I doubt the Xbox will kill board games, but it's nice to be able to sit down and play the games you love without all the hassle of getting everyone together, and still get 90% of the same experience from it. </p>
