  content: what this box does i already do with my computer. hook my PC up to my HD
    LCD TV via HDMI and watch instant movies from Netflix. until their content gets
    better (better selection, better quality) i see no reason to be excited about
    this. hell, the interface isn't even better. you still have to go to the netflix
    website and add movies to your instant queue before you can watch them through
    the box. if this service wasn't free it'd be a rip-off.

  content: But the difference to me is I don't want to have to hook up a computer
    to my TV. To me that's a clumsy solution. (IMHO) This makes the solution a little
    better and easier to me. Do you keep the PC hooked up to your Television at all
    times? Wireless Keyboard and Mouse?

<p>Netflix&Acirc;&nbsp;has released a set top box to interact with the Netflix streaming video service. If you haven't looked yet, the Netflix streaming service has about 10,000 titles that are capable of being streamed to your PC in 30 seconds or less with a high speed internet connection.</p>
<p>Priced to move at $100 dollars this service integrates with your existing account as long as your account is one in the Unlimited status. (Which most are) So for $16.99 per month&Acirc;&nbsp;you can watch movies on demand with a larger library. Not sure how pause and resume works, but at a flat rate who cares right?</p>
<p>The device currently supports HD outputs including HDMI,&Acirc;&nbsp; but doesn't have any HD content. This would lead most to believe that Netflix has some intent on delivering HD quality material. (Or most likely HD compressed beyond all&Acirc;&nbsp;hell where the only HD aspect left over is the 16:9 aspect ratio)</p>
<p>With iTunes losing the NBC content (although rumors are circling their in talks again) and the attractiveness of this product and the Netflix library, this could be a fatal blow to the Apple TV. Granted that the Netflix device doesn't support podcasts or audio, but honestly the average user won't care about that.</p>
<p>I'm the biggest Apple fan boy there&Acirc;&nbsp;is. But even I have to admit that Cupertino could be in trouble in the movie business. It's all about content to me.&Acirc;&nbsp; We all know how much I hate streaming service on the computer, but if I can get it on the televisoin that's a whole new ball game. I spent some time today poking through the available titles and they've got a little something for everyone. (Including a good display of Anime films)</p>
<p>So yeah, I'm pretty sure this is where my next $100 bucks is going. Even if I have to skip out on comics for a little bit.......ok maybe not. I'll sell something. You get two kidneys right?</p>
