  <p style="text-indent:20pt;">It's sad that Apple isn't doing more with the Apple TV. It's the kind of platform that has a serious wealth of potential, but appears to be neglected by the boys at Cupertino. (Kind of like .Mac) But my day-to-day usage still has me loving the product.</p>

<p style="text-indent:20pt;">It's sad that Apple isn't doing more with the Apple TV. It's the kind of platform that has a serious wealth of potential, but appears to be neglected by the boys at Cupertino. (Kind of like .Mac) But my day-to-day usage still has me loving the product.</p><br />

<p style="text-indent:20pt;">I still use the AppleTV on a daily basis for podcasts, photos,  TV shows, streaming movies and most recently, YoutTube Videos.  The YouTube component is interesting and fun due to the integration with your web interface. As I go through YouTube throughout the day, I'll often flag an item as a favorite so that it's easily accessible when I get home. The only hard part with it has been knowing if the video I intend to watch is both on the web AND available for viewing on AppleTV. If it's in the top-rated or has over a million hits, I'm usually assured that it'll be available. Other than that though all bets are off.</p>
<p style="text-indent:20pt;">I love the added sense of options given to me while watching Apple TV, most notably in the podcast arena. I'll be<a href="http://www.crankygeeks.com"> Cranky Geeks </a>in the morning while I'm getting ready for work. Before I leave I give the iPod a quick sync so that I can continue watching it from the EXACT point that I left off from at home. I watch the rest of the episode on my lunch break and start another show. When I get home, I sync again which removes the episode from AppleTV as well as syncs my current position in the show to the AppleTV. I pickup where I left off in the comfort of my living room. It's a sweet, sweet setup.</p>
<p style="text-indent:20pt;">Digitizing my library is an awesome thing, especially since I'm getting more and more of my library in MP4 format. So Stephanie and I just sit back, scroll through our options of films or TV shows and lazily watch without having to get up. It's also a LOT easier to figure out what you might want to watch when you can scroll through the list from the comfort of your sofa. Again, sweet.</p>
<p style="text-indent:20pt;">So far the only downfall has been audiobooks. (Which I'm beginning to fall in love with) I get my Audiobooks from <a href="http://www.audible.com">Audible.com.</a> As I learned today, Audible uses a different encryption/DRM scheme than Apple. A scheme that is currently not supported on the Apple TV. OOPS.</p>
<p style="text-indent:20pt;">I'm hopeful for the future as well in regards to my favorite Apple toy. As I flip through the settings on the Apple TV, I notice that there is a setting in which I can choose what iTunes Store I'd like to be connected to. Does this mean that I'll be able to purchase music, movies and tv shows right from Apple TV?</p>
<p style="text-indent:20pt;">Again...sweet. Time for some newly purchased HOUSE..or maybe Battlestar Galactica? Hmm..choices choices.</p></p>
