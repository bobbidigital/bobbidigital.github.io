  content: Again, I'm probably in the minority, but I don't think this is that bad
    of a thing.  Personally it sounds like it's a lot safer for overcompulsive people
    such as myself, who removed the purchase verifications in iTunes.  I can just
    click happily away, and before I know it I'm down $60.

<p>"To buy even a single 99-cent song from the Zune store, you have to purchase blocks of "points" from Microsoft, in increments of at least $5. You can't just click and have the 99 cents deducted from a credit card, as you can with iTunes. You must first add points to your account, then buy songs with these points. So, even if you are buying only one song, you have to allow Microsoft, one of the world's richest companies, to hold on to at least $4.01 of your money until you buy another. And the point system is deceptive. Songs are priced at 79 points, which some people might think means 79 cents. But 79 points actually cost 99 cents."</p>
<p>So fucked up. Read more <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.forbes.com/digitaldownload/2006/11/zune_stinks.html">here.</a></p>
