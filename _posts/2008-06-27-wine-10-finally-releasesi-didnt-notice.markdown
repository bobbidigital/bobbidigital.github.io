<p>I was reading an article on Macworld announcing the<a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/134033/2008/06/wine.html" target="_blank"> Wine 1.0 release</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>After 15 years of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;pain&acirc;&euro; and &acirc;&euro;&oelig;despair,&acirc;&euro; open-source developers on Tuesday celebrated the release of version 1.0 of the Wine emulation software by, you guessed it, opening a few bottles of wine.</p>

Wine allows Windows applications to run natively on other operating systems, including versions of Linux, Unix and&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;thanks to <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/134010/2008/06/crossover7.html">Tuesday&acirc;&euro;&trade;s commercial release of CrossOver</a>&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the Mac OS.</blockquote><br />
I remember when I was running Linux as my OS of choice, it was a lonely world. We live in a Windows world still to this day 10 years later. Linux has matured however and the latest top dog Ubuntu seems to have captured the hearts of many. One of the problems with living in that world was the lack of applications to replace your current Windows solution. I can remember the sheer excitement I had when I finally got GAIM to compile and not crash everytime I launched it. So back then, Wine was a God send.</p>
<p>But now that time has passed and Linux is much more mature, there are a lot of software solutions out there, is Wine really needed? Sure there are those business apps that only run on WIndows, but chances are the users of those apps will be running on Windows anyways.</p>
<p>For the home Linux user is Wine still relevant? Still, Kudos to the development team. Better late than never. It was a long hard road.</p>
