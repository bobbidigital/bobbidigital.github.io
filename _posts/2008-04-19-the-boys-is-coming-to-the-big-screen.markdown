The rights to a feature film adaptation of 'The Boys' have been acquired by Columbia Pictures and will be produced by Neal H. Moritz.</p>
<p>The series takes place in a world filled with superheroes who suffer from the pitfalls of humanity. They're selfish, egotistical, sadistic and what's worse, almost unstoppable. Enter 'The Boys' a team funded and formed by the CIA to help keep superheroes in check. Sometimes The Boys have to use some rather unorthodox tactics to keep the superhero population in check. But it's a hell of a ride.</p>
<p>I'm a fan of the series, even though it's a bit...intense for some readers. I would imagine the series would have to take on some almost comedic aspects. If you've read the book than you know exactly what I'm talking about. </p>
<p>Makes me wonder if they'll cast Simon Pegg as Hughie, considering that's who the character was based off of. Who else would I cast? Hmmmm... I'll have to do some digging. Mother Milk will be an easy cast. There's only like 4 black actor's big enough to play him.</p>
