<p>The news is starting to come out again about Comcast looking to <a href="http://news-briefs.ew.com/2009/09/30/comcast-nbc-universal/" target="_blank">purchase a stake in NBC Universal</a>. Historically cable providers have really been nothing more than a dumb pipe to your house. But with Comcast's previous attempt at a hostile takeover of Disney and now their bid for NBC Universal, the Internet should be very worried.</p>
<p>If we look at a future where Comcast owns not only Content, but also the pipe into your house, we are looking at a world that just seems extremely counterproductive to the future that many Internet lovers have envisioned. Comcast is a company that has a keen interest in <strong>preventing</strong> users from viewing content on the Internet. Think about what a world where Hulu type services are rampant and what that means for Comcast.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced revenue from fewer cable subscribers</li>
<li>Increased costs due to higher bandwidth demands</li>
<li>Pay-per-view purchases drop</li>
<li>A loss in up-sell products (Other than bandwidth)</li>
<li>Long term growth plan looks very murky </li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>But if you're in a world where Comcast owns content, they can shape the way you access that content. Do you think it's in their best business interest to keep sites like Hulu filled with their content? Maybe in an altruistic, future shaping way, but not in the harsh world of reality.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that Comcast will be out to squash Internet TV or at the very least heavily control it's access. I could see them providing a streaming service for their cable subscribers. What might happen to iTunes? Would Comcast pull content off of the iTunes store in favor of their own on demand service?</p>
<p>The current deal is only rumored to be for about a 20% stake but that will be the start. A 20% stake doesn't buy Comcast much in the way of true content ownership, but if they could finagle a controlling stake in the company, then things begin to look a little better for them; and a whole lot worse for us.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out on this one Internet.</p>
