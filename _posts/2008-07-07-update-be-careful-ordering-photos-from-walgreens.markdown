  content: wow...that is really, really bad. And a little bizarre, too. How is that
    safe? I mean, how can they get away with doing that?

<p>Got a response from customer service.&Acirc;&nbsp; Looks like this is a known issue.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">This is actually a known issue with photo orders sent to the local store with our "Quick Pay" option. The below disclaimer is displayed above the place you enter your credit card information. </span> <span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />
</span></p>
<table style="height: 164px;" border="0" width="403">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td><br />
</tr></p>
<tr>

</tr></p>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-size: small;">Your credit card will be charged after the order is picked up. Important: If your friend purchases any additional items during the order pickup transaction, your credit card will be charged for their total purchase amount. &Acirc;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
</span></span><a><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Show me how this works</span></span></a></td><br />
</tr><br />

</blockquote><br />
So it looks like this was my bad.&Acirc;&nbsp; Don't know how in the hell this is acceptable. I won't be doing this again that's for sure!</p>
