<p>I finished reading the graphic novel <em>Whiteout</em> this week by one of my favorite writer's Greg Rucka. The story centers around a US Marshall stationed in Antarctica who is charged with solving the murder of an expedition team. (It was also recently turned into a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365929/">motion picture</a> starring Kate Beckinsale.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/images/whiteout_tpb.jpg" height="200px" alt="Whiteout by Greg Rucka" style="float: left; margin: 0px 6px 6px 0px;"> While the book was great, I feel like a full review would probably reveal too much of the story and a short review wouldn't be worth reading. I'll say this about it, read it. (I haven't seen the film)</p>
<p>Reading the book however put me in a certain mood. THere was something familiar about it that was exactly what I wanted. It turns out it was the setting, Antarctica. There is something incredibly satisfying about a book, graphic novel or film that is set in a harsh outer environment. In <em>Whiteout</em> the harsh temperatures serves as another character and almost like another antagonist throughout the book. It's an enemy that has to be dealt with constantly and doesn't choose sides. It's the type of enemy that can't be bargained or reasoned with. It kills indiscriminately.</p>
<p>I <strong>LOVE</strong> that about this book and others like. It works particularly well with locations of extreme cold. The extreme heat just isn't as exciting. (dying in a desert takes a lot of time) Films based underwater are as exciting to me for the same reasons the cold interest me. My roommate Shawn suggested space movies as well, but here is where I call foul. In most space films, the fictional timelines in which they are set have usually mastered space travel. It's no more dangerous than driving on the highway. (Unless you're driving I-90/94 in rush hour)</p>
<p>So now my goal is to consume films and books that have the environment as a character. One where the environment is as hostile as the antagonist. The problem is, I have no idea how to search for films and books like this. So far my list of known works are slim. Any ideas?</p>
<ul>
<li>Whiteout</li>
<li>30 Days of Night</li>
<li>The Thing</li>
<li>Ice Station Zebra</li>
<li>Vertical Limit</li>
<li>K2</li>
<li>Alive</li>
<li>The Abyss</li>
<li>DeepStar Six</li><br />
</ul></p>
