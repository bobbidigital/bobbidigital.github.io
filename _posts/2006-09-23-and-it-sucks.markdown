Well, it seems like it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s just that time. Steph and I have decided that we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re moving in together. It actually comes in great timing considering what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s going on with my sister. So Gloria will move into this apartment and I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m packing my stuff to be into the new place by September 29th. I would rather we got a place together, but I can see her not wanting to move again.</p>
<p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve been in this place for almost 4 years now. I think it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the longest I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve ever lived somewhere other then home. The positive thing about her place is the only memories in the place are ours. No history with others, nothing to remind us of things past. Just her and I.</p>
<p>But on another note, packing absolutely sucks. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s been tough going through ALL the things I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve collected over the years, different stages of my life. I actually found an old journal that I wrote in for a long time. I think the first entry was way back in 1999. Interesting to read and see where your head was. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s nice to know I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve come so far, but depressing to see how things have stayed the same.</p>
<p>Anyways, I better wrap this up. Steph is on her way with more boxes. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s been a disaster area today. Marco&acirc;&euro;&trade;s shoot was cancelled too, so that kind of sucks. I was looking forward to using that new camera. Oh well. Always next time.</p>
