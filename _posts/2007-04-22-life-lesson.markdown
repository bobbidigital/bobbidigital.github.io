<p>I didn't write this. My boy Jay did, but it just has a good message.</p>
<blockquote><p>effort has something to say about value. many things will come easy in life, and it's those things that when they leave again on their circuitous paths, we either disregard or realize we've taken for granted. how often do you place great value in something (at the time) that has taken no effort to gain? it's more likely the things that you've fought for, and paid for, and sacrificed for you will cherish the most. the universe keeps a tab, and never stays out of balance for long. if something comes easy to you, yet you've had the wisdom to recognize it's importance, then pay for it, before the bill comes due. and with a smile tip the waitress at least 20%</blockquote><br />
