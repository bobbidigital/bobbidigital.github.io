<p><a href='http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/batmanallstars8.jpg' title='batmanallstars8.jpg'><img src='http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/batmanallstars8.thumbnail.jpg' align="left" alt='batmanallstars8.jpg' /></a> So anyone who knows me knows how much I have absolutely hated the Batman All Stars series to date. There have been glimpses of hope every so often, but all in all I've been thoroughly disappointed. I keep it on my subscription list with the hopes that maybe one day the series will find itself and make me happy again. I think that day has come.</p>
<p>The Joker is all I really need to say. I saw the cover and instantly fell in love with the new rendition Lee and his team have given an absolutely awesome cover. As always the art is strong in the book but I've been kind of disappointed in Miller's writing. He's turned The Goddamn Batman into a goddamn asshole full of goddamn rage and goddamn fury. (Anyone who reads the book knows what I'm talking about) While Batman's anger hasn't subsided, the Grayson character is starting to become very like-able. The opening scenes with The Joker are amazing and make you fall in love with Clown Prince all over again. </p>
<p>I suggest you go buy this book right now. Stop reading and get it. Now I'm not saying the series is turning around by any means, but this is definitely a step in the right direction. </p>
<p>I also picked up the first couple of issue of B.P.R.D and the Iron Man Annual. Ooh and the next issue of The Boys came in. Between this and Mass Effect it should be an awesome weekend.</p>
