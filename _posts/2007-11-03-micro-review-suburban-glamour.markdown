    Hey there,

    Thanks for the review! Glad you liked it. Just wanted to clarify, though, that Nikki and Eleonora did the pin-ups at the back of the book, and I drew (as well as wrote) the actual comic.

I just grabbed the first issue and I must say I really enjoyed it. </p>
<p>The writer, Jamie McKelvie does a great job of setting up the story. He weaves modern pop culture references into the dialogue without making it sound like he's shoving it in with a shoe horn. The artwork is great and so far its been an excellent diversion from the run of the mill Super Hero, punks with tights crowd.</p>
<p>i won't tell you the premise, simply because when I picked it up I wasn't sure what the premise was. Personally that made the read even MORE interesting in my opinion.</p>
<p>It's a 4 parter so hurry and grab it....nowish....</p>
<p>Check out the artists as well.</p>
