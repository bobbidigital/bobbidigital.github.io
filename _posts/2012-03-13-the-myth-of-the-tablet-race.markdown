    They might care. I have an Asus Transformer Prime and my wife has an iPad2. Every week she sees me doing something and wants me to set it up on her iPad. Sorry, Apple won't let you.

    The Android tablet market will increase as people with Android phones ask why their phone can do something that&Acirc;&nbsp;their&Acirc;&nbsp;tablet can't. I want to be able to do what I want on my phone and tablet, not what the company who sold it to me thinks I should do. Until then, you won't ever see me with an Apple product unless I win it in a contest.

    @twitter-15779107:disqus&Acirc;&nbsp;I think that's a fair point, but seldom do I see those situations that are compelling enough to have a user switch. My friend is always talking about the things he does on his Android tablet. (Like Bit Torrent) I feel the envy of the filesystem or expandable memory, but in the long stretch the pros of Android never outweigh the cons to me. (Or more accurately, the cons of leaving the iPad)&Acirc;&nbsp;

    To each their own of course. But as tablet manufacturers continue to struggle, it'll be interesting to see how many keep trying. Samsung might already be seeing the writing on the wall.&Acirc;&nbsp;

     While I agree with your thesis I can't help but dismiss most of your supporting arguments as Apple fanboy elitism. There is no factual basis for your assertion that "there are more iOS fans than Android fans." And while Apple is famous for generating supportive fans that are willing to pay for apps, they are also famous for arbitrarily limiting capabilities to force their users to upgrade, artificially limiting capabilities to preserve the "iOS experience" and just plain pissing off people who would like to use the hardware they purchased in a way that Apple may not have originally intended or even conceived. As for audience engagement, look at the Android forums on XDA, Android Central, and Rootzwiki. They are vibrant and full of developer/user interaction.

    I also think you should think about total app revenue versus revenue from the purchase price of an app. Angry Birds wasn't even going to be released as a paid app on Android because the guys at Rovio were making millions on ad revenue! Maybe Apple consumers are willing to pay more up front, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are more "valuable" in the long run. I'm also curious to know how Amazon's marketplace compares to Apple's app store. I don't know, but I bet it is better than Google's own marketplace.

    So what does all this have to do with the "tablet war?" Nothing. Apple was first to market with a quality combo of hardware and software, just like in the phone arena. Two years later Android tablets are FINALLY catching up in hardware specs and design aesthetics. The tablet software is slowly coming around, but ICS is taking forever to rollout bringing a quality software experience to Android tablets. Once that happens then the iPad will actually have something to consider as a competitor. And then there might actually be a war...

  content: Your arguments are valid, but for a different conversation. This isn't
    the "Is Android or iOS better ?" debate because I don't think that can be answered.
    "Is Android or iOS better for you?" is the only question that can be answered.
    I like Android. But the Mac is my computer of choice and it has applications that
    I live and die by on a regular basis. The iOS devices allow me to continue my
    work on the go in a very similar fashion as my desktop experience. My brush with
    Android was very positive, but it just doesn't fit into my workflow due to integration
    issues. Many people don't have those integration issues and for them Android is
    a great experience. But again, that's not the argument I'm making.Audience engagement
    is different than consumer engagement. Yes Android fans are very active and draw
    from their open source community roots. But I'm talking about average people.
    You and Chris (the other commenter) are far from average consumers. Soccer mom's
    don't need BitTorrent clients or HDMI Out on their phones. There's definitely
    a group of people that do it, because they can, and for them Android is a great
    choice. But in the larger consumer market, they are the minority. We see the same
    thing happening in television. Sure fans of Firefly are hard core and have a great
    level of activity. But the American Idol audience is much bigger, even if it is
    a little less sophisticated.&Acirc;&nbsp;As far as revenue goes, take it from
    a dev. Ads are not an easy way to live unless you do a LOT of downloads and impressions.
    And when I say a lot, I'm talking several million impressions per month. It sickens
    me when people talk about ads as a viable revenue model. If you have a runaway
    hit (like Angry Birds) yes, you can do quite well on any platform. But if your
    "Bob the Developer", a one man team trying to make a cool word processor app,
    ad revenue or in app purchases simply don't fit. Not to mention there is the growing
    concern of ad-blindness. The same people who go out of their way to block advertising,
    cookie tracking, etc are the same people advocating ad revenue as a business model.
    The two are in competition with each other. As a developer you do not want to
    go into a product thinking ads will pay-off, because more often than not, they
    don't.You're right, my assertion about Android fans versus Apple fans stems entirely
    from my personal interactions with people. I talk cell phones with a lot of people
    on a regular basis and I run into two types of Android users, people who are platform
    advocates and people who liked the handset, Android just happened to come with
    it. iPhone owners on the other hand are over-zealous about their phone choice.
    Are they fanboys? Probably so. But as a developer, I don't care. As long as they're
    spending cash on my app. :-)

    Just wondering if the latest "Boycott Apple" campaign has affected your views regarding this matter.

    I'm also simultaneously fascinated and disgusted by how aggressively Apple is suing to destroy competitor products instead of licensing out patents. I know, per the law, Apple has every right to sue to protect their patents and all that. It's starting to make Apple look insecure and not being confident that they're fanbase is loyal enough or that they can continue making products that will create the same fervor.

    My original disgruntledness about Apple was when Microsoft started on going for the app store, proprietory apps so on and so forth. As you addressed a little in this entry, I'm growing&Acirc;&nbsp;a dislike of being forced into a certain paradigm. Frankly, that's one thing that's kind of appealing about Windows-machines vs Apple-machines right now, the ability to choose from a variety of software. I've got other preferences for Windows OS options (I like network settings on Windows much better, mostly). Looks like Microsoft wants to take away that freedom, too.

    Honestly, I'm seriously thinking about going Linux if Apple and Microsoft keep going these directions. Maybe it doesn't necessarily have the variety of software options, but it doesn't have corporate competition causing that problem. I feel like I would need to make some kind of stand like that to keep my ability for choice on my technology.

    Feels like it's turning into a certain degree of "Freedom of Expression" or something. I know Microsoft and Apple aren't true government entities and all that, but still. . .it's kind of funny considering one of Apple's early commercials reminiscent of George Orwell's 1984.

    @facebook-637208569:disqus&Acirc;&nbsp;My arguments are relatively unchanged. The tablet "war" still isn't happening. iPad clearly leads in all categories with some 65% market share. I still believe the primary drive behind adopting Android tablets will be price. Amazon and Google are making in-roads with their $200 dollar priced tablet, but in reality prices that low force them to become content sellers more than hardware manufacturers. And even with that, developers are still the key. On the tablet front, the various tablet sizes make life hell on developers. Applications vary in performance and aesthetics based on the developers ability to gain access to multiple devices. Samsung alone has a 7.0, 7.7, 8.9 and 10.1 inch tablet. Despite the 3 iPad models, they're all the same size. The only thing you have to account for is pixel density, which is a relatively trivial thing.

    I spent time with an Android tablet. There were a lot of REALLY cool things that I liked in missed. But having switched back to the iPad(3) the experience overall is much more fluid. I don't mind being stuck in the ecosystem so much, but I do miss the ability to integrate 3rd party apps deeply into my experience. The number one feature I used on the Android platform is the "Share" functionality to send links, images, etc to other applications. When I moved back to iOS on the tablet, I felt castrated. I could tweet a link or I could mail it. Or I could copy it, close the app, relaunch the target app and paste it. The experience can't even be compared. Some iOS apps bake in this share functionality, but you're stuck using the services that the developer has decided to bake in. Boo.

    With that said though, the openess of Android IMHO generally accounts for a lot of the sub-par software. Its hard to make the experience extraordinary when you're dealing with an unknown number of configurations. (My biggest problem with the Android tablet I used was piss poor performance across the board)

    I'm waiting to see how the Nexus 7 does. Biggest complaint I've heard about it so far is 1. The screen is a bit dimmer (not a huge deal) and 2. Apps haven't been optimized for the 7 inch screen, so a lot of things look like poop.

    Tablets and apps are like buns and hamburgers. Both are important and they have to be paired with the other in mind.

    Yeah, going from Laptop/PC to iPad, I fell in love with the ease of posting links to social media and the ease of opening links in social media. You also bring up the good point of there are still limits there. I guess I've just worked around that, for at least FB.&Acirc;&nbsp;I have my Tweets automatically posting to FB via a simple setting in Twitter. That option doesn't really help for Google+ or LinkedIn, though.

    I agree. The integration of apps with each other is probably biggest selling point of mobile technology. It has been such a strong point that I've wanted that level of integration on my laptop, which seems to be what we're getting with new OS's.

    Interesting part about Android not having best performance BECAUSE open source doesn't&Acirc;&nbsp;provide&Acirc;&nbsp; for strong&Acirc;&nbsp;quality control. I guess that's something I, personally, would take as a price I'm willing to pay.

    In the end, I guess I don't have a problem with a company leaning so strongly on proprietorship of software and an app store. My biggest problem is if there isn't an open source option out there. . .and Apple seems hell bent on destroying the open source competition through the law rather than market-force competition. It's the destruction of other options that I don't like, especially when Microsoft seems to be going down the road of App Store Proprietorship, too. It makes for great DRM, but rubs my desire for that ability for self-expression even at the cost performance.

    I also really get rubbed the wrong way that Apple doesn't have a return or trial policy for apps that you have to pay for. In the year or so I've owned my iPad, I've purchased two apps that I thought would do exactly what I needed but ended practically being junk to me. Yeah, buyer beware, do your research, etc. etc. but there just seems like there should be a better way to address the matter. No matter how many reviews&Acirc;&nbsp;you read, there's always that chance the app won't do what you need it to do (and an available friend doesn't have it to test it).

    On the note of tablet size, I read a week or so ago that Apple is developing a smaller tablet to compete with the one Google wants to release and also the Kindle. From what you've mentioned, will be interesting to see how things unravel there.

    From what you've said, I can infer that your reaction is that consumers pretty much want the performance and ease of use that iPad allows. The biggest issue with the iPad for real mass consumption is going to be the price point. If iPad could get their price point down, they would very likely truly dominate the tablet marketplace. On a fairly good note, looks like they're going to try doing that with a new, smaller tablet sometime in the future. Than again, Apple really isn't known for aiming for lower price points. . ..

<p>When I hear tech media pundits talk about the tablet race I laugh hysterically. It's this sort of involuntary reaction, the kind I'm sure Apple executives have when rumors of the next product launch circulate the web. The idea that there are competitors to the iPad is severely misplaced and really shouldn't be a secret to anyone. I'm not saying that there no other quality tablets out there, I'm saying that people don't want tablets, they want iPads. The fallacy that there is a large market for Android tablet users stems from <a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/consumer/more-us-consumers-choosing-smartphones-as-apple-closes-the-gap-on-android/">market share numbers</a> that show a lead in Android sales over iPhone sales. But success in the phone market means absolutely nothing in the tablet game.</p>
<p>The problem with market share as a measure of success for mobile platforms is that it doesn't take into account the quality of the consumer. Instead market share reports a simple percentage and assumes that all consumers are equal. Anyone that has been even a casual observer of Apple's business practice knows that's not the case. Despite Apple holding a <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/10/12/apples-share-of-u-s-pc-market-leaps-to-12-9-in-3q-2011/">dismal percentage of the PC market share</a> pie, their revenues have far exceeded that of any other computer manufacturer. Apple consumers are worth more than the average PC user. I'm not going to debate motives behind it, but Apple consumers have shown a clear willingness to pay a premium for what they perceive is a quality good. In comparison, the average Android consumer is looking for a cheap alternative smartphone, but not specifically an Android phone.</p>
<p>To further dig this point in I'll use an example. Think of an election. You may vote for the President, but you simply picked the Water Reclamation Clerk based on party loyalty. The Presidential candidate might get a donation from you, but the reclamation clerk probably won't get a dime. Something similar is occurring in the mobile OS market. There is no clear OS choice, it's just the OS that came on the phone when you purchased it. There are more iOS fans than there are Android fans. Looking at market share, this seems a bit counter-intuitive, but there is a difference between choosing an OS and being given an OS. I challenge you to go to your local cell phone retailer and find a non-iOS phone that isn't running Android. The market is inundated with Android devices. There are plenty of consumers that love the endless configuration choices. But average consumers are making their choice of phone based on handset design, not around the Android platform. The consensus of course is "so what, they've got the phone!" but that logic doesn't hold up for developers, which serve as the engine for any mobile platform.</p>
<p>Developers need engagement from their audience. They need people who are looking for apps and are willing to pay for them. Once you place the world in that context, the number of handsets becomes a moot point. Soccer moms who don't want the iPhone simply want to check e-mail, weather and Facebook. If the purchasing experience is smooth enough, you might be able to talk them into downloading a game or two at a fair price. But usually that's the extent of their experience in the paid app realm. Apple on the other hand is world famous for their ability to engage their customers and build a type of loyalty like no other company in history. Not only are Apple fans loyal, but they pay a premium for the privilege. Android's fan base isn't anywhere close in terms of brand loyalty. Most of the diehard Android fans I talk to are also Open Source junkies, which doesn't give them a huge track record of paying for software. The numbers look even more dismal when you look at revenue generated by each app store, with Apple's App store generating <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2397918,00.asp">four times as much revenue<a/> as the Android Marketplace.</p>
<p>So far all we've talked about are mobile phones, but where does this leave our tablet war? It leaves it as a lop-sided victory. Like a classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_and_dump">pump and dump<a/> scheme, the numbers paint a picture of a market that doesn't exist. Consumers don't want Android tablets, because most of them don't want a tablet at all. They bought Android phones simply because they wanted a smart phone, but for some reason didn't want an iPhone. (Some may have enjoyed Windows Phone 7 <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2386538,00.asp">had it actually been pushed on them</a>) The iPhone however was crafted around the idea of a specific experience. When people are looking at the iPad, they're looking for that same experience, but on a larger device. It just so happens that larger device resembles a tablet. Android users on the other hand are just looking to make phone calls, check Facebook and browse the web occasionally. The Android experience doesn't compel the user to move it to a larger screen or device. The idea makes even more sense when you look at the number of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethwoyke/2011/12/08/blackberry-owners-want-ipads-and-so-do-android-and-windows-phone-owners-survey/">Android users that own iPads!</a></p>
<p>While the phone war rages on, the tablet war should really be relabeled as a skirmish. The Android experience, number of handset options and openness make it a strong competitor to Apple's iPhone. But in the tablet market, it's simply not there. I know there are millions of things the Android tablets can do that the iPad will never allow you to do. You maybe reading this and creating a laundry list of all the awesome things you can do on your tablet. But if you stop and listen for just a second, you may hear the rest of the world whisper. </p>
<p>"We don't care."</p>
