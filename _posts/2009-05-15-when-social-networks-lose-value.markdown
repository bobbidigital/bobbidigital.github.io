  content: Facebook is too "closed" for my liking; too much needing to confirm friendships,
    etc. If you only want a small group of people to stay in touch with then maybe
    that's the way to go but for me FriendFeed is far better at discovering new people,
    new things, and just for general interaction.

  content: I think facebook is good, I think people should re-evaluate their idea
    of Friends, most of my friends on facebook go out with me and meet up with me
    in the real world, and the other friends listed are out of the area and I just
    like to "stop in" and see that they are doing well.  I don't general accept anyone
    that I don't know personally or through someone I am friends with.  I like that
    you have to confirm friends and that you have some privacy controls.  I love that
    I can recieve invites when my freinds are coming back in the area too ;-)

<p>As the World Wide Web begins to expand our uses for it continue to expand, particularly in the realm of social networking. Our idea of a "friend" is also slowly being altered thanks to tools and applications that allow us to maintain "friendships" with minimal effort. I put friendships in quotes because of the rapid ease in which we begin to assign a once coveted title. The rules for friendships are beginning to change. But with that change in rules we start to tier our friendships. This isn't anything particularly new, just expanded. (Everyone had a BEST friend) But with the onslaught of information we're sharing it's becoming increasingly difficult to keep it all together. </p>
<p>For me, Twitter served as a means to keep in touch with a lot of people I didn't know and even to make some new friends. Facebook was intended to keep in touch with my real world friends, mainly because it was the tool I figured most of them would be using. But now that these worlds are starting to mix it's becoming increasingly more difficult to keep up with the folks that are part of my real world life. Not to say that my digital friends are lesser (here comes that hierarchy again), but the expectations of a friend are substantially different in the digital versus analog world. It's easy to tell when those digital relationships take on higher meaning, because you begin to convert them (or add them) to your analog world.</p>
<p>So I've been trying to figure out a way to stay in touch with as many of my analog friends as possible, using tools that are helpful to me. As much as I like Twitter, the signal-to-noise ratio is becoming less and less acceptable. I'm not sure how others do it, but I know that I don't have time to stay engaged with Twitter in a way that's both beneficial to me and my followers <strong>AND</strong> doesn't feel like work. So far it seems like <a href="http://www.friendfeed.com">Friend Feed </a>and <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> are the two best options for me.</p>
<p>Friend Feed looks particularly attractive because it's an aggregator of many sites and it has the added bonus of not requiring a user to actual be a part of Friend Feed in order for you to aggregate their data. (Check out the Imaginary Friends section of FF) It also has a pretty easy way for me to approve of other users content via the like or dislike option. A lot of Twitter clients also support Friend Feed, so there are more options out there than I would have originally guessed. The problem I have with Friend Feed in its current role in my line up is that I have no real reason to go to it. I don't post any information there, it's just an aggregator for me. But if I'm not there to post data, I'm not there to browse data. It's a vicious circle. If I can commit to making my updates on Friend Feed and choose which data services cross post then that could be one problem solved. Friend Feed also has pretty good support for Lists. Lists allow me to categorize different types of friends so that it's easier to keep track of them. It's very much like group services in Twitter that you see in clients like TweetDeck, Nambu or the new Twitteriffic 2.0 software. The major difference is that the list functionality is built into the application, making it widely available on all the different client types. If I'm in a rush and only have a few minutes on my mobile device, I may only check in on my analog friends to see what's going on.</p>
<p>Then there's Facebook. The mac daddy of them all. Facebook met most of my needs except two main things. The first is the lack of a variety of clients. You're pretty much using the website or the iPhone application. It be nice to have a tool that would allow me to do small quick things like looking at News Feeds and posting status updates. I know the Facebook iPhone app does that now, but the more clients, the more innovation and the more options. Facebook doesn't look like it has any real grouping options, but it does let me hide news feed updates, which is helpful. Nothing is worse than missing a piece of valuable information in your news feed because some dumb ass from high school thought it would be cool to post all her photos from her drinking weekend.  The other option is to simply not follow people I don't have a serious vested interest in. Sure you're excited to catch up when your first crush ever friends you on Facebook. But once you find out where they're at in life now, the novelty kind of wears off, but you're still stuck with their updates.</p>
<p>How do you manage all your social networks and still maintain valuable relationships?</p>
<p>p.s. And after writing this I spoke with a friend who told me about "Lists" in Facebook too. So now Facebook might very well be a more useful tool to me.</p>
