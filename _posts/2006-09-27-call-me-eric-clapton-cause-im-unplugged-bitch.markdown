Tonight I'll be moving my road runner and cable boxes. Which means I'll be without the Internet in my home for an entire day. It's sad to think about, but it's true. Subsequently my phone will be out as well. (Damn digital phone service) So the only way to reach me will be a ring on my cell or a quick visit to Niskayuna.</p>
<p>You know, blogging is so much easier when you don't keep getting a blank page every other click. I never really understood the draw to MySpace. It's captivating yet retarded and frustrating all at the same time. It's the worse interface I've ever seen. The technology is spotty at best. The load times suck. Yet we keep pouring in like mindless drones. I've tried other sites like Friendster and it seems like they're only big in other countries. I figured after Fox bought it (Myspace) they'd put some money into it. No such luck thus far.</p>
<p>I'm getting that programming bug again. I've been working on a php Module for my UI website, but even that's been taking a back seat with everything else going on. I really want to get back into that though. Management quickly sucks all the techy digit-head stuff right out of you.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, October 13th bitches. Keep it on your calendar. Cause the party is going to be jumping. Actually I don't know if that's true. I just know we're gonna all try to go out. Holla if ya wit me!!</p>
<p>See you guys on Friday. (That's when Road Runner should be installed)</p>
