<p>Sometimes you're sitting at your desk and you want to send a text message to someone. Specifically a text message, not an e-mail. Maybe they're out and you need them to get it right away? Maybe they don't have e-mail? So the only option is to drag out your phone and play FAT FINGER THOMPSON with your iPhone as your pudgy little fingers try to navigate the touch screen. Well now there is another option.</p>
<p>I say "now" like I haven't been using Teleflip forever but whatever. Teleflip is a service that allows you to send text messages to your friends via e-mail. Every phone carrier allows you to text a phone via an e-mail address. Each carrier has a slightly different way of formating it though. For example Verizon uses phonenumber@vtext.com.&Acirc;&nbsp; AT&amp;T uses phonenumber@txt.att.net. This is already getting old so you see the dilema. Enter Teleflip.</p>
<p>Teleflip using some voodo magic behind the scenes allows you to send a message to one easy address. phonenumber@teleflip.com. From there it doesn't matter which carrier your recipient uses, teleflip will forward it to the appropriate address. The recipient receives the message via text along with your e-mail address. Boom. Simple.</p>
<p>Another bonus is that if you don't have e-mail on your phone (get with the program already) you can sign up with Teleflip so that they convert e-mails from your favorite senders and have them delivered to your phone via text messaging.</p>
<p>Aren't you glad you read this?</p>
