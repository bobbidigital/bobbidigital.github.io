  content: "Hi, \r\nUnfortunately there is no escape from information overload....I
    use a simple summarization application to get the instant \"headlines\" of what
    I read. This helps me to quickly decide what is of interest and what I can ignore.\r\nCheers,\r\nHenry"

  content: "Twitter's a big help, at least if you use it like a news/conversation
    feed. Having to compress the basic idea down to 140 characters is a key part of
    that.\r\n\r\nOf course, some folks just don't get how to do that, and write stuff
    like, \"This is really interesting [link]\" and I have no idea what it is!\r\n\r\nAggregation
    is important. Several years ago, I tried using an RSS reader, but it was mostly
    a distraction. Now that RSS is integrated into the browser, it's a big time saver.\r\n\r\nI
    think there's a limit on how many different places we can track, not just how
    much at each place."

<p>I've noticed that over the past couple of weeks, I've just kind of blindly scrolled through my RSS feeds. I skip over a series of boring articles or articles being reported by 15 different news sites. I scroll through Google Reader ignoring the many many list posts. The Top Apps, The Top, Sites, The Top blah blah blah. </p>
<p>Do we need another evolution in data aggregation? Or do I just need to pick better feeds. Social networking news is also starting to turn to crap as I watch scores and scores of uninteresting useless DIGG articles scroll their way to the top. I remember when everything on DIGG was awesome. (Of course it was only tech stuff then)</p>
<p>Is anyone else experiencing what I'm going through? It's difficult to put into words, but I guess I'm just getting the feeling that between blogs, RSS feeds, podcasts, vidcasts, newspapers, that I'm just getting overwhelmed with info. Now that I'm taking a step back from it all, I'm seeing that most of the info is crap.</p>
