<p>So the news is out all over the Interwebs that Steve Jobs will not be giving the keynote address at Macworld. The Macworld event has long been heralded as the time when Apple will change the computer industry for the coming year. But in reality the Macworld announcements should be looked at more like a baseball player with a.300 batting average. Yeah he's good, but when you actually LOOK at history he's only on base 30% of the time. The Macworld keynote functions in much the same way.</p>
<p>I'm not surprised by the news and contrary to investor beliefs, I don't believe this has anything to do with Steve's health. There are 2 key reasons why Steve will be streaming the keynote from home. It's the last year that Apple will participate in the Macworld event. (Apple is NOT the organizer of Macworld so the show will continue) Trade shows have been dwindling in their usefulness and their participation level in recent years. Macworld isn't the only trade show in trouble and Apple isn't the only big vendor bailing. Adobe has decided not to do any exhibits at Macworld as well. In these troubled economic times (take a drink) companies are finding more ways to trim and cut costs. When looking at a balance sheet the trade shows are an easy decision considering the cost of booths. The cost/benefit ratio just isn't there any more and has become more PR than an actual revenue generator.</p>
<p>The other reason is more simple. Apple doesn't have anything to announce. Each year bloggers, podcasters, journalist, analysts, we all go ape shit trying to figure out how Apple is going to change our every day life. The fact that they're delivering the keynote makes us even more rabid in our hunt for news. But Apple doesn't release a device like the iPhone every year. Not to mention Apple would probably prefer to handle their own product announcements so that they can do it, I don't know, maybe <strong>BEFORE</strong> the holiday season?&Acirc;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I'll put hard earned cash on it. Right here, right now, you read it here first. Apple's keynote at Macworld will be a snoozer. No major updates, no earth shattering events. We might see a refresh of the Mac-mini or something like that. We've all been scratching our heads wondering what the big word is going to be in January and I think Steve's decision to bail gives us our answer. So enough with the rumors of Steve's health. (Although the boy could use some meat) You always skip out on a party when nothing's happening. Steve's no different.</p>
<p>If they deliver some ground breaking new product in January then I will eat my words and say a prayer for Steve. Until then I think the man just has a classic case of malnutrition.</p>
