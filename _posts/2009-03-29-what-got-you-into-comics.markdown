<p>Not too long ago we had a Comic Book Swap meet at Third Coast Comics here in Chicago. The brilliant thing about this event is that it gives you a chance to get rid of your old issues and a chance to sample some other titles you may not normally purchase.</p>
<p>The format is simple. We all get together and bring a bunch of different comic books. The comics are split into two tables, the first table is for comics that you want to give away and people are allowed to take. This was great for a lot of people who couldn't read all the things they wanted to while they were there, and it gave collectors an opportunity to fill in some of their missing items. (Shawn found a few missing issues for some of the series he collects) The second table is for all those comics you want to share with folks, but you would liker returned by the end of the night. This table typically consisted of trade books that people were bringing in. In our case it was nice because once you actually meet and talk with folks, they're more than willing to let you borrow books and return them at the next meeting. All in all it was a great event and we had a lot of fun with it. I believe we plan on doing it again very soon!</p>
<p>Below is a video of Third Coast Comics owner Terry Gant telling us what got him into comics and what made him open his shop. Another video will be coming soon!</p>
