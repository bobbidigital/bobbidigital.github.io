<p>Well hello there! My name's Sharif and I am a man-child with an almost encyclopedic memory of comics and all things related to them. My friend Jeff here was mad enough to grant me some blog space at ATD and personally, I am just here to take over and make his life miserable. Now that I've set the stage, let me explain why I am here wasting your valuable time before your 1PM meeting with the same people you imagine smothering with a pound of used kitty litter.</p>
<p>My addiction to comics is almost akin to Mr. Glass' in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217869/">Unbreakable</a> with the exception that comics have a cryptic message showing us that superheroes and villains are secretly fighting all over the world (and universe!).&Acirc;&nbsp; Ok, maybe I think they're out in the universe but they have surely bypassed this backwater planet. Before Marvel and DC decided to pillage their titles for movie adaptations ( I still gag when I hear about the Corman Fantastic Four. And I am not bothering to link to it because I want you to keep your lunch and chai latte down.) I have always had the notion that some comics would make great adaptations. Now, I would say maybe 65% of the adaptations that have occurred have been phenomenal (The Dark Knight, even with all its mistakes), awesome and fun (Iron Man), and just straight ridiculous (Spidey 3,&Acirc;&nbsp; Wanted, I mean really, binary code from the universe? I was half-expecting a copy of the Secret to be in Wes' father's room).</p>
<p>Before I get off-track, my updates will be looking at past comic series and even a few contemporaries and discussing just about anything about them, from character development, adaptations, and even ones that deserve adaptations with suggestions for actors, blah blah blah. So, I hope to break up your day with a little fun and geekiness in the only way I know how. Until then, buy your Watchmen tickets as soon as you can because it's going to be a fun ride, with or without the squid. Next post I'll be talking about a killer comic about a professional killer who begins to slowly lose his mind in Matz' and Luc Jacamon's The Killer. Talk to ya....<br />
