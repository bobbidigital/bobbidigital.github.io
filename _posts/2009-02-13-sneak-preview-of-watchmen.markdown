<p style="text-align: left;">At 7PM, March 2nd, I will be attending a sneak preview of Watchmen and the following day (probably that night since I most likely will be too wired to go to sleep) I will give my two cents worth on this 20 year wait for the big screen adaptation of Watchmen. Alan Moore, I really wish you would just say fuck it and go, but I digress.</p></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">UPDATE: Here is a trailer of the Tales of the Black Freighter to be released on DVD March 24th. For the uninitiated, this adaptation is based off of a comic a minor character reads throughout Watchmen and it actually foreshadows a major part of the plot which I will not reveal. A mariner adrift at sea desperately struggles to get back to his hometown to warn the occupants of the coming pirate ship, the Black Freighter. He sheds his proper, nobility for survival as the character and the audience are shocked by the conclusion of the story as well as the main story this comic resides in. A brilliant story-within-a-story. Check the trailer after the jump.</p></p>
