  content: You my friend, have tapped into the same exact thought I had when thinking
    of the next Batman film. He would be PERFECT as Nygma as there isn't another actor
    right now that could even be remotely considered for the role. As long as they
    don't pick an actor known for comedic roles to act like a nutcase ala Carrey.
    Good post, man, very well put.

<p><a href="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/emerson.jpg">Michael Emerson</a> is by far one of the strongest actors on television today. His role as the character Benjamin Linus on <em>LOST</em> evokes a range of emotions from different viewers. Imagine my surprise when I looked at his <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0256237/">IMDB credits</a> and saw nothing listed after <em>LOST</em>. Why is it that someone isn't banging his door down to play the next great villain in a film? Well if I had my way, I'd cast him in a role I think he was made for. The role of Edward Nygma, a.k.a The Riddler.</p>
<p>The Riddler is of course one of Batman's A-list villains from the comic books. Previously the role was made disgustingly laughable by Jim Carrey in 1995's Batman Forever. The role was a joke (by no fault of Carrey's) and in my opinion didn't give Nygma the chance he deserved. But in the hands of talented writers such as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634240/">Nolan</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0333060/">Goyer</a> the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>The Riddler's persona is governed by his modus operandi as a criminal. His world, his life and his very existence is rife with riddles and puzzles of the mind. Everything is a series of complex layers, which ultimately become more interesting than the actual answer itself.  But the key to making The Riddler appealing to a modern, and more sophisticated audience, is to make his riddles more than just "Black, white and read all over". The riddles will need to make social commentary. They will need to force us to look at the grotesque violence that he will undoubtedly instigate, as an extreme response to a problem with which there is no viable (and digestible) solution. Can we wipe out poverty by simply killing all of the poor people? That's a simple example but gives you the idea for the type of audacious stunts I would expect to see come out of The Riddler while at the same time posing it to us as a game in which the answer seems complex, until you actually arrive at it.</p>
<p>My case for Emerson as Nygma is a simple one. Watch any episode of <em>LOST</em> that involves Benjamin Linus and see how Emerson handles "stringing us along" as we vie for the answers to the series. We know that Ben's mind is a trove of information. Instead of unleashing it all on us, he allows it to drip out in small bits. Like a leaky faucet, the truth forms in a bead, perched on the lips. Linus is quick to envelop the truth with a perspective peppered with deceit and half-truths. He delivers this new product with a candor that demands you treat his new revelations as gospel. The fabrication is carefully weighted with an ounce of truth so that when it falls into our pool of known information, it causes ripples in our perceived reality. You never know if Ben's guidance is bringing your view into sharper focus or if it further muddies your alleged awareness of truth.</p>
<p>Emerson's work is the blueprint for the type of evil and conniving characters that intrigue and pull at the emotions of viewers. In some episodes, you're surprised to find yourself rooting for him, hoping that everything has been a big misunderstanding. When the essence of his self-service reveals itself to you, the disappointment you feel manifests like a lump in your stomach, real, and perfectly tangible. It takes more than great writing to evoke a response as strong as Linus does. It takes a talented actor.</p>
<p>These are the qualities that I hope can be elicited from Emerson in the role of The Riddler. Now I guess I should say that I have no news if Emerson has actually been cast, but it would be an excellent choice both for him and for the franchise. I can continue to dream!</p>
