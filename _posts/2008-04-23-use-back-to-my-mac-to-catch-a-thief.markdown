<p>Interesting story from Roughly Drafted Magazine.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Daniel Eran Dilger<br />
</strong>After a burglar broke into her truck and stole her iPhone and MacBook, a woman in Santa Cruz teamed up with a friend to use Mac OS X Leopard&acirc;&euro;&trade;s &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Back to My Mac&acirc;&euro;¬ù screen sharing feature to track and identify the thief for the police.<br />
<strong>Back to My Mac<br />
</strong>The owner had multiple accounts on the MacBook, and at least one of the administrator accounts was tied to Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s .Mac service. That enabled the pair to locate the stolen MacBook using Leopard&acirc;&euro;&trade;s new Back to My Mac, a feature that advertises the location of a registered machine to its owner whenever it is connected to the Internet, enabling easy remote access.</p>
<p>The stolen laptop has popped up several times as the thief has connected to various WiFi signals. Even without an ideal network connection, the owners have been able to start screen sharing sessions, access their files, remove sensitive data, change passwords, and even take pictures of the thief using Photo Booth.</blockquote><br />
