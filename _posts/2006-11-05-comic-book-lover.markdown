<p><img width="310" height="194" align="left" src="http://www.bitcartel.com/comicbooklover/pics/macbook-comicbooklover.jpg" />I don't know how many of you read online comic books. I like the concept of being able to carry all my comic books on an external drive. I like the idea of digitaly sorting them, reading them online and not having to worry about ripping them. I know that most people enjoy the feeling of collecting them and I can't argue that point. (I already lost this argument with CDs and MP3s) But you've got to admit there is a convienience to this.</p>
<p>I found a program called ComicBookLover for the mac. This app is pretty cool. Not only is it a comic book reader, but it's also a library management system for your digital replicas. It has an iTunes style interface which allows for all types of meta-data information for searching through your library. Its also got digital previews which is pretty cool. Check it out at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.comicbooklover.com">http://www.comicbooklover.com</a></p>
<p>It makes me wish that there was a way for comic book publishers to embrace the digital era. I'm not sure how the DRM would be handled and I imagine that's the real hurdle.</p>
<p>I guess we'll just have to keep pirating it for now.</p>
