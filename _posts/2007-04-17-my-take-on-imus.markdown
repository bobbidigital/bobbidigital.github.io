<p>Who gives a fuck? The guy makes a living saying foul shit all the time and NOW we want to give him a problem. He's a SHOCK JOCK. That's what they do. They say silly stupid inhumane shit. So I guess now we'll be going after CarlosMencia, and just about every black comedian in the world. We (I'm black so we refers to the African-American community) scream and rant about equality. But when someone does the same thing we've been doing on stage to whites because its entertaining, we throw ahissy fit. That's part of it! Not separating ourselves from the rest. Every race, color and sex is the brunt of a joke some where. My girlfriend and I (who is white) always make fun of our two races. Not because we're abnormal, but because there ARE cultural differences. Being aware and comfortable with those differences is what makes us capable of sharing a laugh ABOUT our differences.</p>
<p>I honestly think if it wasn't for the great Al Sharpton, this would have blown over in a weekend. Is it fucked up what he said? Should the Rutgers team feel insulted? Yes. But it's bullshit coming out of some washedDJ's mouth. I guess we should hunt down every midget on the planet and give them a great big hug. They've been the brunt of many a shock jock joke. But I don't see the RAINBOW coalition standing up for the little folk. The biggest thing I've heard was "It wasn't in the context of the show". Maybe you haven't listened to the show then. Because any Imus show I've ever heard, ANYTHING was fair game. But that's just me.</p>
<p>Now one thing I will say is fucked up is the FCC. Now the FCC as a body has recently become the morale police of the radio waves. They've done that on their own and have, by default, accepted that role. So when Howard Stern says "titties" on the air, the FCC comes in slaps him around and gives him a fine.</p>
<p>So why is it that Imus can make such a disgusting statement and the FCC says boo? In my mind that's the FCC saying "It's OK to talk down to niggers, just don't mention their tits". I think the FCC is at fault for condoning his behavior through lack of action. Should he have been fired? Probably not, but the same stance on radio indecency should be taken across the board.</p>
<p>It's early morning so I'm not sure if this came out the way I wanted it to. The bottom line is, sorry Imus, you suck, but I don't think it played out the way it should have.</p>
