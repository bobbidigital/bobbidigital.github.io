<p>Interesting article discussing the option of using a Mac-mini as a media center machine. It's always been argued that the Mac-mini has the ideal form factor for media center machines. I of course opted for the Apple TV, but the options that are proposed in the article are interesting. Especially the PVR stuff. </p>
<blockquote><p>APPLE TV OR MAC MINI?<br />
No getting away from it &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; I still yearned for a Mac based media centre. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d hoped Wii Transfer would fit the bill, but the quality of the video streaming isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t good enough (yet?).</p>
<p>That meant either a Mac Mini or an Apple TV, but that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a hard decision. Apple TV has the ease of use that makes it ideal for the home. No fiddling about, but no PVR functionality either. In the end, I went for the Mac Mini&acirc;&euro;&trade;s potential over the Apple TV &acirc;&euro;&tilde;just works&acirc;&euro;&trade;, and using FrontRow and EyeTV to provide the interface.<br />
