<p>This orchestral piece will immediately sound familiar to any science fiction fan that listens to it. Chances are though you might not have heard it verbatim. The piece was originally composed in 1914 by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Holst">Gustav Holst</a> and was the source of "inspiration" for John Williams' score for the Star Wars film.</p>
<p>It's nice to know that even the great John Williams borrows from time to time. It still doesn't diminish the awesomeness that is the Star Wars score. Below is a YouTube video of the original piece performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. It is one of 7 movements for his suite known as "The Planets", with each movement representing a different planet. Enjoy.</p>
<p>p.s. If you're reading this on Facebook, go to the actual <a href="http://www.allthingsdork.com/?p=624">blog</a> if the YouTube link isn't working.</p>
