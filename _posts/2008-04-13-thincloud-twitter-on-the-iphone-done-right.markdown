<p>For those of us with the iPhone who are too chicken to Jailbreak their phones, we've had to sit back and watch a wave of good Twitter clients pass us by. The mobile version of the Twitter site leaves a little to be desired, but fulfills our basic needs. It's not pretty, but it's fast and for what it offers fairly efficient. For those few things that we miss, we turn to Thincloud.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.thincloud.com/">Thincloud</a> is a mobile version of Twitter designed specifically for the iPhone. It has all those missing features that you wish the mobile version of the official Twitter site had like being able to follow new people, looking at replies specifically to you, or even just simply checking your direct messages. </p>
<p>The application doesn't revolutionize the Twitter experience in anyway, but it is a much nicer interface than the standard mobile version offered by Twitter.com. I would highly recommend giving it a try.</p>
