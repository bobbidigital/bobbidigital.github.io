<p>I guess to say I'm not excited isn't an accurate statement. I guess for me it's more the reason why I'm not waiting for the Google OS to come to a phone I like. </p>
<p>People rant and rave about 3rd party apps and all the stuff they love to do with them. But I ask you, what is it that you're doing on your phone? "I do business stuff on my phone." I have a Treo 700p and I can't imagine doing ANYTHING work related other than e-mail on it. Sure I have an SSH client on it and it's pretty much worthless. Not that it's a bad app, its just very impractical. Trying to use VI is tough enough on a full size keyboard, let alone trying to mash my man-paws on the Treo keyboard.</p>
<p>So again I ask, what are people doing on their phones that is so precious? I mean the idea of an open platform is nice, but I just haven't seen the greatness of mobile computing just yet.</p>
<p>Music, Email, Web, Maps. That's it. That's all I really need in a phone. (And maybe a good app for doing tasks) But that's all I could possibly imagine doing natively on the phone. Sure there are a gangle of popular web apps, but those will run on Palm's shitty OS.</p>
<p>So please, someone tell me why this is going to be the iPhone killer? The iPhone still does something that no other phone can do. It reduces my number of carried devices by integrating my phone, my iPod and my mobile web. And with the Apple SDK coming out I'm sure there will be a plethora of useless apps out there.</p>
<p>So for you mobile freaks out there, what am I missing? What apps are you using on your phone?</p>
