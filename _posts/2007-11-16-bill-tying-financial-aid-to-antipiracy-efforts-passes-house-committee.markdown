<p>This is an absolutley outrageous idea, but in today's climate it doesn't really surprise me. Revenue streams for big media need to be protected at all costs!! With piracy running rampant, if we don't fight it than we let the terrorist win! These are the types of things that I would imagine this bill would have in it. </p>
<p>For those that don't know, I'll give the 30,000 foot view.&nbsp;<br />
<blockquote>The House Education and Labor Committee unanimously passed the College<br />
Opportunity and Affordability Act of 2007. Among other things, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071111-new-bill-would-turn-colleges-into-copyright-cops.html">the COAA</a><br />
would require colleges and universities to adopt strict antipiracy<br />
policies and possibly offer students access to subscription-based music<br />
services like Napster.  </blockquote><br />
The bill would tie a schools participation to it's eligibility for Financial Aid Funding for Students.</p>
<p>The reality of it is that the bill could have been dunked in human urine with a small line at the bottom that says "Help us or die" and the bill would still be where it is now. Hollywood and the record industry have some big dollars. And big dollars come in handy during things like...oh say campaign financing. So to be surprised that a bill this audacious could be presented doesn't surprise me at all.</p>
<p>And if it surprises you, than perhaps you haven't been paying attention closely enough.&nbsp; The country, and the world for that matter, is quickly becoming a dark place where corporate profits are the ends that justify any means. The record industry would rather risk the future to line the pockets of the present. Rather than be forced to adapt to the changing demands of the consumer, the entertainment sector would rather use the government as a tool. It's a horrific thought.</p>
<p>But again we shouldn't be surprised by this. In a world where customer service has been replaced with 2-year contracts and early termination fees anything goes. And as long as the juggernauts all offer the same shitty service, we as consumers get screwed. With the Internet and our level of connectivity to one another, we as consumers have more power than ever, yet we're less free as consumers.</p>
<p>It's going to take sacrifice in order for us to realize our full potential. It's going to take a coordinated effort for us to stand and say that we'd rather do without, than to do with on your terms. It's just not right.</p>
