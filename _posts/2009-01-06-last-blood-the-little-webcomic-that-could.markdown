<p>I love gripping tales even if they employ the same formulaic settings and situations since a majority of times, they are spun in an unique or progressive fashion. Take for instance a zombie title like Robert Kirkman's The Walking Dead, a phenom title with a creative play on who the walking dead are; the human protagonists seeking refuge from zombies who are also the walking dead but not in the same sense as the metaphorical title implies. Using a haunting sense of claustrophobia within the already confined panels of this wonderfully paced comic makes you care about the characters' dilemmas and fragile mind states. So how do you top a formulaic story with interesting and deep characterizations?</p>
<p>With a webcomic named <a href="http://www.lastblood.net/"> Last Blood</a> by writer Bobby Crosby and artist Owen Giani which is about a group of vampires protecting the last group of humans from zombies to ensure mutual survival and a reboot of the human race. Think of Blade (the films) without the one-note performance of Wesley Snipes. Our ragtag group of humans are not exactly groundbreaking but what differentiates this title from Kirkman's is the retro 80s vibe of fanzine meets the internet as well as the fact that it is being made into a movie. Yes, a webcomic is being made into a movie. Surprised?</p>
<p>I give it 3 out of 4 plastic sleeves and consider it a great way to end the last half an hour of your day. So go hit that Last Blood url up, read it, enjoy it, and next time, we're going to talk about Y the Last Man and why D.J. Caruso and Shia LaBeouf shouldn't be part of it.</p>
