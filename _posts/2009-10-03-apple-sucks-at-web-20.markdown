<p><img src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/mobileme.jpg" alt="MobileMe.jpg" border="0" width="200" height="145" align="right" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" />Once is a mistake, twice is a pattern. Let's hope that Apple can stay away from becoming a trendy at producing bad Web 2.0 applications. I've always been disappointed with Mobile Me and its rather lackluster feature set via the web interface. </p>
<p>iWork.com has followed up with an even less impressive display of Web 2.0 savvy in their online document sharing tool for Apple's office suite of products. But in a world with Google Docs, Office Online, cloud disk storage, simply providing a means to exchange documents isn't enough. Here are my list of items that need to be fixed in both Mobile Me and iWork.com to make Apple even mentioned in the world of online solutions.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the web mobile mellow me to check IMAP mail from other services. Nobody wants an e-mail account associated with an annual fee</li>
<li>Allow me to subscribe to calendars via the Mobile Me web interface as well</li>
<li>$99 bucks a year and you give me 10 gigs of space? Really?</li>
<li>Create plug-in support for other applications. Doesn't have to be fully featured, but it be nice to have some sort of plugin-architecture where mobile me can really serve like a desktop</li>
<li>iWork.com needs more collaboration features. Even if it's just allowing me to download a doc, make changes and re-upload them. Allowing people to only make notes makes e-mail a far more efficient system</li>
<li>It would be nice to be able to edit the document online, but I'll settle for the revision control. Just want to be clear that online modification is still a desirable</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>While these aren't the types of things that will make Mobile Me an overnight Google killer. They are however the things that need to happen for it to even be in the realm of possibilities. I love Google, but I"m still not signed up for this complete shift to the Web. I think Apple (or even Microsoft for that matter) is positioned well for the <strong>near</strong> future with a hybrid of desktop and web applications that can pass data back and forth. It's probably more important for Apple due to Microsoft really being the standard around the globe. If I go to the library or need to do something from my job, I may not have access to a Mac.</p>
<p>iWork.com is still in Beta, so there is hope that before it goes gold that some of these features are implemented. As far as Mobile Me goes, I've always got the impression that it was a sort of pet project (much like the Apple TV) that doesn't warrant the attention of Steve Jobs. And as Apple fans know, if Steve doesn't care, neither does Apple.</p>
