First we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll start with the simple stupid yet smart playlist.</font></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">So first of all let me describe for you what a smart playlist is. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s basically a set of saved search criteria that matches to user-defined inputs. (In OS X you can also create smart folders, which behave very similarly) The nice thing about Smart Playlists is that as new music is added, it will automatically be added to the smart playlist if it matches the defined criteria. Awesome!</font></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">So let me give you some examples of a few simple stupid play lists that I have. I created a Best Rap playlist. I defined the playlist to be comprised of all music with a genre of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Rap&acirc;&euro; and a rating greater than 3. This gives me all of my top rap songs to minimize the amount of skipping I need to do through tracks. (This is why genre becomes such an important field) Now every time you add a song to iTunes, if it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a rap song with a rating higher than 3 it&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll be added to your &acirc;&euro;&oelig;smart&acirc;&euro; playlist automatically. Pretty sweet. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve also created a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Greatest Hits&acirc;&euro; smart list, which is basically any song, rated higher than a 3. But lets get even sexier with it.</font></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Sometimes you have those gems that you just don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t seem to listen to anymore. If you have good-sized library, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s very easy for you to lose some of the greats or even get caught up in all the new hip music you have. This sounds like a job for another smart playlist. So what I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll do is decide if I want to break it up by genre or not. Lets say I want to check out my very broad &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Electronica&acirc;&euro; genre. So I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll select that as my genre in the smart playlist. Then I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll say anything rated with a 3 or higher, just because I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t want the crap music. (Which we can easily get rid of using another smart playlist. See! Your catching on!) Then I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll add another rule to say the Last Play is greater than 30 days. Finally just to make sure it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not a crap song that I rated wrong, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll make sure the skip count is less than 5. Voila. I have all my good music I haven&acirc;&euro;&trade;t heard in awhile. I love this stuff!</font></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Need to find all your crap music? Create a smart playlist that has songs with a rating of 4 or better but have a skip count greater than 5. Why? Because if you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re skipping it that often, chances are you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve rated it incorrectly.</font></p></p>

Keep digging around in their and I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m sure you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll find a wealth of other things you can do with it!
