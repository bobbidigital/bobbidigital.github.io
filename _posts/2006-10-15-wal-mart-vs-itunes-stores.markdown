<p>Wal-Mart vs. iTunes Stores  Another thing I noticed is that it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s no longer the iTunes Music Store. I guess they quickly outgrew that title. But with the advent of the iTunes store selling movies certain companies, namely Wal-Mart has taken extreme offense to this.  Wal-Mart has actually gone as far as to push movie studios to not sign up with the iTunes Store.</p>
<p>Wal-Mart has threatened to cease sales of movies in all of their Wal-Mart stores. The theory is that Wal-Mart feels seriously threatened by Apple and is going to do everything in its power to stop the success of movies on iTunes.  But there is hope. Looks like Wal-Mart and Apple (why Apple?) are in negotiations to try and quell the upheaval. Apple Matters has an article <a href="http://www.applematters.com/index.php/section/comments/wal-mart-threats-part-21/">here.</a></p>
