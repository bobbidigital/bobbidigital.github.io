<p>The more I work with NetCentrics plugin, the more I realize that I miss my Kinkless GTD.&Acirc;&nbsp; So much in fact that I may go back to the dreaded paper based system. *GASP* (For those that don't know I HATE paper)</p>
<p>I stumbled upon this <a href="http://gtdv2.icommitonrails.de/ " title="iCommit" target="_blank">iCommit</a> website which is another online implementation of GTD. Many people have said MANY positive things about the site, but I just couldn't get comfortable in it. It just felt a bit clumsy interface wise. Now that may sound petty, but for me an attractive interface is a major piece of the puzzle. Call me a shallow software whore, but that's my opinion. The developer is working on a version 3 which is supposed to look a lot neater. It's in beta at the moment and I've got some high hopes for it.</p>
<p>In other news, I was on Merlin Mann's site <a href="http://www.43folders.com" target="_blank">43 Folders</a> and read his post on Trimming the Sails. Actually it's this guy <a href="http://www.brianoberkirch.com/2007/04/20/trimming-the-attention-sails/">Brian's blog</a>. But he's got some pretty good tips on staying productive. Don't now how many will work in my office where hellish life is the norm, but you never know.</p>
<p>On today's plate is getting out to enjoy the weather! With Stephanie out of town my date will be my iBook. A sad pathetic life.</p>
