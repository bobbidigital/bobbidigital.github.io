<li>Home after a  LOT of laundry. Working on a Motion template for some new vidcast I'm planning.  Then some journaling <a href="http://twitter.com/BobbiDigital/statuses/784801543">#</a></li>
<li>Just woke up. Ribs are killing me. 2nd day in a row. I think Rob Dougan's song "Clubbed to Death" is the most over used song in media. <a href="http://twitter.com/BobbiDigital/statuses/785022734">#</a></li>
<li>I'm getting sleepy for some reason. And I'm craving Sushi for lunch. But the Sushi at the Thompson center sounds....eh <a href="http://twitter.com/BobbiDigital/statuses/785180533">#</a></li>

<li>@bruzer79 blogger about the Chicago Tech startup scene. From what I hear he's a real character. <a href="http://www.themayreport.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.themayreport.com/index.html</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/BobbiDigital/statuses/785363938">#</a></li>
