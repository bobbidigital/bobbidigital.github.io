  it's the same post, save yourself the time. I plan to do more posting at that site

  who has not read Final Crisis #1? Those of you in your office, cubicle or coffee
  shop with your hand in the air, use it to slap yourself. Now get off your duff and
  go get Final Crisis #1, read it and then come back to this review.<br id=\"uzg91\"
  /><br id=\"uzg92\" />Now that we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re all on the same page,
  most of us had a bewildered look as we watched a tragic event unfold. Unfold is
  a friendly term because in reality we were just slapped in the face with it. The
  Martian Manhunter is dead. According to issue #1 of Final Crisis, you get the impression
  he must have been some side character that wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t worthy of a
  hero&acirc;&euro;&trade;s death. Instead he died like an afterthought. The panel
  was treated like a flashback, retelling details that were already known to the world.
  Well Final Crisis Requiem redeems our favorite martian and places him back into
  the hero status he rightfully deserves.<br id=\"uzg93\" />"

Unfold is a friendly term because in reality we were just slapped in the face with it. The Martian Manhunter is dead. According to issue #1 of Final Crisis, you get the impression he must have been some side character that wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t worthy of a hero&acirc;&euro;&trade;s death.

Well Final Crisis Requiem redeems our favorite martian and places him back into the hero status he rightfully deserves.<br id="uzg93" /><a id="more"></a><a id="more-395"></a><br id="uzg94" />Requiem is a retelling of The Martian Manhunter&acirc;&euro;&trade;s death with some history about it. This book fills in some of what happened leading up to The Martian Manhunter&acirc;&euro;&trade;s death, although for some readers there will still be questions. The issue also portrays J&acirc;&euro;&trade;onn putting up a fight, instead of simply taking a spear to the chest and calling it quits. (Clearly the way a punk superhero would go out) Even with a mortal wound inflicted on him J&acirc;&euro;&trade;onn fights a cunning, albeit brief, battle with his captors.<br id="uzg95" /><br id="uzg96" />Unfortunately thanks to issue #1, we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re painfully aware that The Manhunter&acirc;&euro;&trade;s efforts are pointless. He will fall. The rest of the issue deals with his history, shedding some light on the character to those who are not familiar with him. Finally the book ends with Batman leaving a can of Chocos with the casket. I thought these particular panels were moving. They do an excellent job of cementing how grave this loss actually is, while continuing to characterize and bring J&acirc;&euro;&trade;onn to life as a character, even through his death.<br id="uzg97" /><br id="uzg98" />The art in this book is definitely some of my favorite work. Doug Mahnke and Christian Alamy do a good job expressing the grief and rage of the characters in the DCU. The tone for the book is carefully set via the solid black paneling, the dialog and the fact that the story unfolds at night, lending to a particular color scheme. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m no artist so particular aspects or details of the work can be lost on a layman such as me. But like the Joker said &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know if it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s art, but I like it.&acirc;&euro;¬ù The coloring is also particularly striking to me and will probably be one of the first things you notice as you flip open the first few pages.<br id="uzg99" /><br id="uzg910" />The writing is very solid by Peter J. Tomasi, although during the The Martian Manhunter's history he seems to get a little too wordy. That section of the book seems to just drag on without an interesting enough mechanism to tell it. It read, exactly as it is. A dry recitation of history without anything catchy enough to keep us from skimming through the thought bubbles. Now this in no way detracts from the work as a whole, but just creates a bit of a dry spot in an otherwise well written homage.<br id="uzg911" /><br id="uzg914" />If you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re reading Final Crisis than this book is a must have, no question about it. It sets the stage for what I anticipate will be a series of jaw dropping moments in the DC Universe. While the release time of Requiem vs. issue #1 takes away from some of the tension that could have been provided, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s still a great read and a farewell worthy of a hero.<br id="uzg915" /><br id="uzg916" />Until next time J&acirc;&euro;&trade;onn Jonzz.<br id="uzg917" /><br id="uzg918" /><br id="uzg919" /></p>
