<blockquote cite="http://www.flock.com/">So I've been hearing about this Flock Web Browser for awhile now, but I never bothered to check it out. Today somehow I accidentally went to the Flock page and said, sure why not? <br/></p>
<p>This browser is awesome. Integration with Flickr, integration with blogging tools, built in RSS reader. It's AWESOME. I can visit a page, highlight some text, right-click and hit "Blog This" voila. I've got text, a web link and all I have to do is hit publish. And because my blog is tied into twitter and Technorati, it gets pushed out to those sites automatically as well. Love it..absolutely love it. This was more of a test blog to check out the Flock features. So far, I love it. Won't be long before I'm sporting an "I Flock" badge.</p></p>
<p>Did I mention it also has built in del.ici.ous integration? Yeah...fucking sexy.<br/></p>

<p>Flock is an amazing new web browser that makes it easier to share media and connect to other people online. Share photos, automatically stay up-to-date with new content from your favorite sites, and search the Web with the most advanced Search Toolbar available today.</p></p>
