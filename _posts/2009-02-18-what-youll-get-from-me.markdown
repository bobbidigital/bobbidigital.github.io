<p>This to give you a quick primer on who I am and what you'll get from me on Twitter. So here's a brief rundown about me and my style.</p>
<p>I got the idea for this from my buddy <a href="http://www.twitter.com/scottFmurphy">Scott</a>, who got it from our buddy <a href="http://www.twitter.com/leahjones">Leah</a>, who probably invented this knowledge because she's a genius.</p>
<p><strong> Work Life</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I'm a Systems Administrator by day. I work in a testing environment so I'm working on tons of different technologies all the time. I love tech and occasionally like to gripe on Twitter. I may throw out the occasional technical question or two.</li>
<li>I'm a former manager who has gone back to his technical roots. But occasionally I feel like talking about management stuff just for efficiencies sake. From time to time you'll hear me discuss change management, defect tracking,&Acirc;&nbsp; organizational structure, etc.</li><br />
</ul><br />
<strong>Internet Life</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I'm co-founder of the <a href="http://www.chicagonerds.com" target="_blank">Chicago Nerd Social Club</a>, a club dedicated to promoting nerd-centric events in the city of Chicago.</li>
<li>I love Web 2.0 and social networking. You'll see me link videos, talk about new websites and web technologies. You might even get updates from other social networking sites that integrate with Twitter. The biggest one I can think of now is BrightKite.</li>
<li>I host 2 podcasts and I'm possibly looking at a 3rd.&Acirc;&nbsp; My topics include comic books, video games, dungeons and dragons, movies, television, and technology.&Acirc;&nbsp; Sometimes the conversations on the show start on Twitter.</li>
<li>I love meeting and helping people that I come across on the world wide web.&Acirc;&nbsp; So I'm active in meetups, twitter groups etc.</li><br />
</ul><br />
<strong>Personal Life</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most of my personal life is on the Internet.&Acirc;&nbsp; =) I love to laugh and will share funny experiences or anecdotes that I come across in my daily travels.</li>
<li>I read a lot of comic books and a lot of technical manuals.&Acirc;&nbsp; f you're not into either of those it could bore you to tears.</li>
<li>Love me some XBOX 360</li>
<li>I run a 4th edition D&amp;D game every other week. Sometimes I'll gripe about the system</li>
<li>I love Star Trek and Star Wars in that order. I also love their extended universes</li>
<li>I am an admitted Apple Fan boy.</li>
<li>I also love to Twitter about what my <a href="http://www.twitter.com/stefonee">girlfriend</a> and I are doing. That's mainly for our folks back home in Upstate New York but your welcome to follow us too.</li><br />
</ul><br />
That's me. You'll get some of that both on Twitter and on my blog.&Acirc;&nbsp; If your interests match up you may want to subscribe to my podcast as well. (*WINK* *NUDGE*) I hope to see you on them Internets sometime!</p>
