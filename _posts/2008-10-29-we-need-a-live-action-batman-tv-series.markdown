  content: "new approach to an old story.  i like it.  i could see real potential
    in this.  unfortunalty, it'll never happen....cause cool stuff like this hardly
    ever sees the light of day.  i mean, whatever happened to the live-action 'star
    wars' tv series?  i haven't heard anything about that in a while.  that could
    be the best thing ever too, but they'd probably mess that up as well.  great idea
    though.\r\n\r\nryan"

We're not talking about the cheese covered sauce of Smallville.&Acirc;&nbsp; I'm talking about a realistic take on the Batman franchise.&Acirc;&nbsp; The characters in the "Batverse" are so precious,&Acirc;&nbsp; so full of potential and richness. Let me layout my plan for the TV series, starting with the main character.&Acirc;&nbsp; None other than Gotham City herself.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-452"></a></p>
<p>Gotham City is too much of a fucked up place for it to take a background role as it does in movies and even within the comic books. Gotham City IS the main character in this TV concept. Its inhabitants, its look, its feel, the mood and desperation. All of these things make up a city that could carry a continuous series in ANY medium. In television though it works just lovely.&Acirc;&nbsp; Gotham City needs to be brought to life, much like the space station DS9 in the Star Trek franchise. The place has to BUBBLE with ways in which the viewer can identify with, from rising crime rates to shitty overcrowded public transportation.</p>
<p>Rounding out the rest of the ensemble cast is pretty straight forward but we shouldn't have The Batman as such a prominent character. He exists for sure and some episodes of the show would be focused around him. But it doesn't have to be a show where every day we're seeing the Batman slug it out with weird costumed villains. Lets let some of these other characters shine and build on their lives, troubles and relationships.</p>
<p>Cast of Characters</p>
<p>Renee Montoya &amp; Cris Allen -&Acirc;&nbsp; The cops have to do some of the leg work right? Every single problem can't be handled by the Batman in Gotham City. Bring in Renee Montoya and her partner Cris Allen (prior to his transformation into The Spectre) to do some of the lifting from time to time. These characters have a wealth of background to explore and exploit.</p>
<p>Commissioner Jim Gordon - Because no Batman series is right without the Commissioner doing his thing. Maybe even start him off as a Lieutenant and watch his promotion evolve through the show along with his friendship with Batman.</p>
<p>Mayor Frank Hapshaw - A totally fictionalized character by me. But throw in the fact that he's one of the most corrupt politicians in the nation's history, spiced with the fact that he's launched a new independent party out of Gotham which is slowly growing national legs and a pinch of rumored mob affiliations? Smells like drama to me. Especially when he butts head with the straight and narrow Commissioner Gordon and the DA of Gotham.</p>
<p>District Attorney Harvey Dent - That's right folks, no Two-face in this adaptation. Why? Well because it gives us room to create a tragic downfall, but also because Harvey can be used as an anchor into the court room side of the story. Maybe even a possible run for Mayor?</p>
<p>Assistant District Attorney Sandra Whitfield - Another fictionalized character to serve as the DA's "Robin" sort of speak. Maybe she's rumored to have an extramarital affair with a certain White Knight DA? All lies of course to smear his good name. But some temptations are irresistible.</p>
<p>Bruce Wayne - The rich socialite who is the gem of every woman's eye in Gotham City.&Acirc;&nbsp; This guy has way too much fun! Unfortunately he's a self-absorbed ass who doesn't give a damn about anyone. He's ruined the good Wayne name with his boyish antics.&Acirc;&nbsp; He's really only useful for free meals and the occasional fund raiser.</p>
<p>Alfred Pennyworth - The always pleasant butler of Mr. Bruce Wayne</p>
<p>Batman - Who is this mythical Dark Knight? We don't know much about him. Accept that the city needs him.</p>
<p>Dr. Leslie Thompkins - Serving as the Chief Medical Officer at Gotham Central, she's a close friend of Bruce Wayne. Occasionally she helps out Batman on some medical mysteries that are beyond his level of understanding. She also serves as a voice of sanity to Batman in a way that Alfred never could. With a motherly touch.</p>
<p>Anthony Sucharelli - Gotham mob boss. He handles the muscle in town and occasionally rigs an election here or there.</p>
<p>Now with that base of characters you have the necessary components to do all types of story arch. We could do a straight detective piece starring Batman when it goes beyond the means of normal investigation. We can do a Law &amp; Order type of episode with Gordon's group and Harvey Dent's group. We could even do medical mystery with a few guest spots.</p>
<p>The underlying arch of the story is The DA, the commissioner and the Batman each fighting corruption of the city from a different angle. The villains are the mayor and the mob boss obviously.&Acirc;&nbsp; But each episode could bring us a different story brought to us from the streets of Gotham's inhabitants. Single mothers looking for fair rent and wages. (Sounds like a character piece for Mr. Wayne) Mother's fighting for their children's future against gangs and violence, looking for help from Gotham's protectors. (Namely the police, the DA and this new Batman) Murder/homocides that rip the city apart, jewel heists,&Acirc;&nbsp; chemical weapons, the sky is the limit!</p>
<p>The key however would be to make the crimes a bit more normal in nature. Every episode doesn't have to feature the Joker or Penguin. Why? Because we need to make it credible. We need these threats to be pulled in to raise the stakes. And watching a show where the same villains escape prison every episode gets old quick. So we'll be playing up the more human criminal aspects and the psychological effects that living in a town with a man dressed as a bat can have on the criminal underworld.</p>
<p>When I think about this concept I just see SO much potential. The show could borrow from the anime title "Gotham Knights". I can already see the cover with Gordon, Montoya, Allen and Dent with Batman in the middle of them. Or we could go with a more bland "Gotham City". But whatever we do it shouldn't be titled "Batman" because the show is so much more than just the caped crusader. It's all about the corruption that lives and breathes in this fictional town that we all love so dearly. The key is to keep it grounded, much like Nolan has done in his film adaptations. Don't make it too super heroish or it looses some of it's appeal.&Acirc;&nbsp; Most importantly keep it dark, keep it dirty.</p>
<p>Warner Bros if you're reading this feel free to call or e-mail me. I'll help you make this series straight up cash! I mean if people are STILL watching Smallville, what's the chances of this flopping? Don't yo DARE compare it to the Aquaman spin-off.</p>
