  content: agreed, this past weeks ep left a funny taste in my mouth like Pepsi max.
    When you mess with time travel and continuums, you run the chance of either polarizing
    your audience, distancing your audience, or even pushing your audience away. Personally,
    I don't even try and guess what is going on anymore. Like what's up with Walt?
    Is the artifact they found actually an alien artifact/being that is indeed
    'lost' itself? Is this linked to the Bermuda Triangle with ships disappearing
    there and then reappearing somewhere else? This artifact may indeed be related
    to Eureka's artifact down in Section Five.

<p>I'm going to write this post with no mercy to those who haven't watched the season premiere on Wednesday. (Technically the continuation) If you haven't watched it I recommend you go to what ever corner of the web you go to in order to watch television programs. When you're done watching come back to us.</p>
<p>The problem that LOST will run into is that they want to wrap the show up. It's a brilliant idea and I'm amazed the money hungry executives finally decided to kill the golden goose. But now the show has been on for so long and has raised so many questions writers may not be able to answer our questions in an organic fashion. This point was arguably the only flaw that I noticed in this week's episode.</p>
<p>The episode opens by taking us through the morning of Dr. Candle, the Dharma Initiative member that has been featured in all of the orientation films. He gets alerted to the issues going on in The Orchid and heads downstairs to get more info. At this point he begins to vomit from the mouth in an uncontrollable and uncharacteristic manner in regards to a structure the drill team has encountered.</p>
<p>The entire exchange felt like a video game tutorial and was a jarring change from the slow dripping faucet pace the writers have historically used. This character, who normally has been so selective in the info he reveals to us, suddenly tells a mine worker they've discovered time travel. Wow. Seems extremely out of place to me. The divulging of information has become inorganic and rushed. The writers of LOST have vowed that they would begin providing more answers than questions, but does this have to come at the cost of the story feeling authentic?</p>
<p>I fear that the writer's don't have the time to allow the story to develop the way they would prefer. I don't want to take away anything from the top notch writing crew, but the reality is that the story has derailed from their original course. Because it has lost its way (pun intended) the writers are faced with unforeseen hurdles. I have trust in the writers but not in the network executives. I can only hope that this week's premiere isn't indicative of how the rest of the story will be told.</p>
