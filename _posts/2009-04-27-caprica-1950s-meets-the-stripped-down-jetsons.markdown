I loved the re imagined Battlestar Galactica series and almost cried when the Last Frakkin' Episode aired March 20th. I was in recovery from surgery but the following day, I watched my DVRed episode with red eyes and a heavy heart. And luckily, Caprica has come to fill that void in my TV show repertoire albeit almost a year sooner than the premiere of the series. FRAK! But is it large enough to fill the cracks BSG left behind.</p>
<p>Yes and No. Why the bipartisan answer? Because it is different yet alike, black yet white. At first glance, you're waiting for the Cylons, the heavy artillery, the Space: Above and Beyond-inspired shots of ships with that little zoom added for dramatic effect but you won't be seeing that anytime soon. This is a sci-fi show heavy on the family dynamic like a hyper-serious Jetsons without Rosie or the flying ships.  But do expect lots and lots of tech-heaviness such as pieces of durable paper capable of sending emails or hologlasses that can transport you into an online underground that's a mash-up of Zion, Club Hel, The Limelight, and Dante's Inferno all in the virtual space of an opera house (hmmmm, methinks I am beginning to see the symbolism behind the Opera House so prominent throughout the BSG reboot). And that's not the end of it.</p>
<p>Enter Zoe Greystone, daughter of brilliant computer genius Daniel Greystone (hmmm, Daniel?). She has created an avatar of herself that is an almost perfect copy of Zoe. The only problem is she exists only in the virtual world unlike Zoe who can travel between the two with the ease of a Neo. Zoe has bigger plans under the guise of the One True God (hmmmm) but there lies, as usual, other motives desired by others unknown to Zoe. And this is just in the first 15 minutes. </p>
<p>Without spoiling it for those who haven't had the chance to purchase the DVD of the pilot, this prequel series is a worthwhile addition to your library. The feel and look of this pilot are a compliment to BSG's bleak, dark outlook for humanity amongst the war between man and machine. This isn't standard fare with regards to sci-fi territory as the focus again is on the relationships between the Adamas and the Greystones (an interesting juxtaposition of morals, ethics, and desire) as well as within each clan. This is a refreshing series pilot and if this is any indication, Caprica may surpass it's predecessor in more ways than One.</p>
