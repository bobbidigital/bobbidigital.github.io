<p>I debated about posting this here, but then I realized that all of this Internet stuff is all vanity press anyways. That and I've been a bit busy so I haven't posted here in awhile. Most of my readers who follow me on Twitter probably no all about this.</p>
<p>A friend/co-worker of mine was at lunch when he heard people coming out of the Daley building saying that their lives were in danger. Police were on the scene but no news crew. He looked around a bit and called me at the office, asking if I had seen anything on the web. I checked Twitter first. That's where I usually get the latest buzz but nobody was talking. I checked the major Chicago papers and then checked CNN.com but no data.</p>
<p>So I did the next thing I could think of. I posed the question to all of my Twitter followers, one of which being the online persona of the Chicago Tribune, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ColonelTribune" target="_blank">@ColonelTribune</a>. The Colonel being the die hard journalist that he is got to the meat and potatoes of the story. A story that nobody else was covering.</p>
<p>Check out this article which goes a bit more into detail about the exchange.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=31&amp;aid=148745" target="_blank">http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=31&amp;aid=148745</a></p>
<p>I'm in no way saying that the end of traditional journalism is here. But I'm damn sure saying that it is evolvoing. The simple fact that getting my info from @ColonelTribune was the first thing I thought of says a lot. The Tribune has become PART of the Chicago Twitter community, not just a leech that sucks from it. He contributes valuable information, shares your valuable information with his followers and while you know he represents the Tribune Company, never do you feel like corporate america is invading your space with advertising. He's a friend like any other and no 30 second TV spot in the world will give you that kind of connection with potential customers.</p>
<p>Other companies are doing this as well, such as Frank from Comcast as <a href="http://twitter.com/comcastcares" target="_blank">@ComcastCares</a>. Frank is vigilant in trying to make sure people get the service or help they need from Comcast. He's helped me on several occassions. While Comcast's strategy isn't quite as robust as the Tribune's it still shows that Comcast is looking to engage their customers no matter the medium, which says a lot.</p>
<p>Anyways, I hope you enjoy the article. Here's that link again so you don't have to scroll back to the middle of the article.</p>

<p>Sorry for the lack of posts lately. We'll be working on a podcast soon! We missed a week with technical issues and people vacationing. We do have a special video review for you though that should be going up soon. The first of many.</p>
