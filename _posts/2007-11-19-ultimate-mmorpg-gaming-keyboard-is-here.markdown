<p>This looks like ....well...I'm not sure. It could be cool and it could be booty. I'm not typing any screenplays on it. At $80 it's a lot cheaper than the <a href="http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/">Optimus Maximus</a> keyboard. Albeit not nearly as sexy.</p>

Hailed as the "world's first 2-in-1 PC gamepad and keyboard," this unit is supposedly geared towards MMO players and features a "Blue Moon" backlight for playing after hours, a pair of USB 1.1 ports, built-in volume control and support for both Macs and PCs. Interestingly, the device will be sold exclusively through Dell (at least through the holiday season), and while the press release claims that you can pick one up now for $79.99, it appears that it hasn't been added to the firm's website just yet.</blockquote><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/11/19/wolfkings-warrior-xxtreme-80-through-dell/"><cite cite="http://www.google.com/reader/view/#stream/feed%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.engadget.com%2Fweblogsinc%2Fengadget">Engadget Article</cite></a></p>
