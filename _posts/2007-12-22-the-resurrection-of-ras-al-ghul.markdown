<p>Reading this 7 part series made me think of a very famous quote from a legend of our generation. "I wish I had 4 hands so I could give it 4 thumbs down". The book was boring, dull, didn't explain how the hell Ra's came back and it made you want to choke Batman's son Damian.</p>
<p>The art in all but the Robin portions of the book is absolutely stunning. It's an incredible collection of artwork on every single page. The real problem comes inside the talk bubbles. It's as if the writers took turns shitting inside the bubbles and then said "Yup, that's our story". When I went to the comic book shop and they told me I had the last book in the series, I was kind of disappointed. Because I'd actually have to read it. Oh well.</p>
<p>On another note, I'm picking up the <a href="http://www.dccomics.com/graphic_novels/?gn=5272">DMZ </a>series as well as trying to get my hands on the <a href="http://www.dccomics.com/dcunlimited/wow/?action=the_comic">World of Warcraft </a>series. I'll let you know what I think.</p>
