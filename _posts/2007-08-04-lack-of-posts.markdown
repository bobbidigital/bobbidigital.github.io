<p>I apologize for the lack of updates. Some big news has been going on recently. I'm relocating to the Chicago area! I got a dream opportunity and I simply can't pass i up. The good news is my buddy Dom is actually relocating as well with his girlfriend. So we should already have some company when we get there!</p>
<p>The move date is August 24th which isn't a lot of time to pack and get everything out. So I might be a bit dormant over the next few weeks. Just bare with me, I'll be BACK!!  Any readers from the Chicago area ? :)</p>
