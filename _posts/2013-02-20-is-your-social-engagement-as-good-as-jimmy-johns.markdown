  content: Applebee's ought to be banging on the door of whoever created Jimmy John's
    social media strategy, because whoever's in charge of their social media is a
    hot mess.

<p>With the bitter cold strangling the life blood out of Chicago, I decided to work from home and avoid the dreaded trek from my house to my car. (I have a low tolerance for -7 wind chills) Like any impromptu plan, I found myself unprepared for the ritual that cubicle captives call lunch. Of course in Chicago not having food on hand isn't a problem thanks to a million and one delivery options. I needed my lunch fast, delicious and cheap. Enter <a href="http://www.jimmyjohns.com">Jimmy John's.</a></p> </p>
<p>I ordered my usual from them and continued working, my phone close by. Jimmy John's is known for their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0aJHtsx7Tw">freaky fast delivery</a> and they live up to the slogan. Except today. I'm not one of those insane consumers that doesn't believe in mistakes or fluke occurrences. If you've spent any time actually working for a living, you know that things go wrong from time to time. About 40 minutes into my wait for sustenance, I started getting nervous. For those of you who don't have a Jimmy John's nearby, you're probably thinking "40 minutes? That's <strong>nothing</strong> for delivery time!" But I was being 100% truthful when I said Jimmy John's is fast. My typical order from them usually takes no more than 15 minutes. (I order that often. Don't judge me)</p></p>
<p> So for me, 40 minutes seemed like a long time. I was starting to panic. Did they lose my order? Did I miss the call? Was some poor delivery driver wandering around in sub-zero temperatures trying to find a way to communicate with me? My mind was racing, like a helicopter parent whose child is 10 minutes late getting home from soccer practice. I used a similar emergency thought process too. Do I call? Am I overreacting? Will they think I'm a psycho for freaking out? I wasn't sure what to do, so I did what any self-respecting millennial would do. I logged onto Twitter.</p></p>
<p><img src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/jj_tweet_1.png" alt="@jimmyjohns is usually freaky fast. how long do I wait before I call and ask what's up?" title="jj_tweet_1.png" width="413" height="79" style="padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;" /><br /></p>
<p>My goal was to gauge just how neurotic I was being. But incidentally, my tweet kicked off a company triage system that was pretty damn impressive. I mentioned Jimmy John's Twitter handle, but mainly as etiquette, considering that I was talking about the company specifically. I got back a response, which isn't completely surprising in today's hyper-connected environment. But then I got a DM from their corporate account asking for my contact information. Later that evening, I received a phone call from their franchise consultant and another phone call from the area manager about 30 minutes after that. Both apologized emphatically for the delay and gave me a relatively detailed plan on how they intend to resolve the issue so that it never happens again.</p></p>
<p>What impressed me most is that you could tell this method of reaching out wasn't a one-off situation. Any company might have an overachieving person on their social media team that drives out these types of resolutions. But this response seemed ingrained in their culture. It was a business triage process that had been used in the past. The area manager didn't even have all the details of what occurred, but knew that a customer was unhappy. (I actually wasn't unhappy, just hungry)</p></p>
<p>It's refreshing to see a company take their social media strategy serious. Hiring a dedicated person to sit on Twitter all day is a great first step. But the level of engagement that I witnessed today takes it to a whole different level. And as clich&Atilde;&copy;&Acirc;&acute;as it sounds, customer service really does win loyalty. Subway can use as many B level athletes as they want in their commercials, it still won't match that 3 minute phone call from Jacob. Or that simple apology from the JJ Twitter account. Social engagement will be the only endorsement deal needed in the future. Companies better get their strategies ready.</p><br />

<p>p.s. Seriously, what's with Subways endorsement deals? If you have to tell me who the endorser is in a lower third, than is it really worth it?</p></p>
