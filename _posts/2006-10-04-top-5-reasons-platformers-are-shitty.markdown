Unfortunately with all the work, move and UI stuff that's been going on I've only got time to right 5. But those 5 are really at the center of my hate. Now most of this sound Mario centric, but that's only because Mario is the last platformer I've played. Remember that this apply to 95% of all platformers and they all suck dick equally. I'm not saying enjoying platformers makes you gay....just means you wear a gay uniform.<br />
5.&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; &Acirc;&nbsp; <strong>Shitty Enemies </strong>&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; When have you ever found an enemy that was worthy of your time in a platformer? NEVER! Platformers are required by design to insert at least 15 shitty enemies per game. (Come on&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;.fucking Mushrooms with feet?)</p>
<p>4. &Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; &Acirc;&nbsp;<strong>Shitty Death Sequences </strong>&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; There is no COOL way to die in a platformer. Sometimes you play a game and you're excited about a board even though you died. Frantic serious action! No ..on platformers you feel like a fucking tard because you missed the ledge. Boo</p>
<p>3. &Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; &Acirc;&nbsp;<strong>Homosexual color schemes</strong> &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; MOST, not all but most platformers suffer from color schemes that make you feel like Ryan Seacrest. No game should make me feel like Ryan Seacrest.</p>
<p>2. &Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; &Acirc;&nbsp;<strong>Explaining it to your girlfriend always sucks</strong> -- What would you rather say to your girlfriend? A. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;In this game you have to kill this monster by shooting him in the eye and lobbing grenades at him&acirc;&euro; or B. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;These evil turtles and mushrooms kidnapped my girlfriend and now their hiding her in the shitter of some castle. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve gotta run around and collect loose change to save her.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>1. &Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; &Acirc;&nbsp;<strong>Stupid fucking plots</strong> &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Ok, the first time it works, but time after time I get sick of doing the same shit. That stupid bitch in Mario gets kidnapped twice a year. Let me give you a real world example of how stupid this chick should feel. A surgeon is only going to remove a lit cigar from your ass ONCE. The second time and every time thereafter you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re on your own. Mario should take the same mentality. Luigi too.</p>
