Somehow we got talking about this at work today and I was suprised how many people haven't heard about it! Net Neutrality is basically the belief that no site should be favored for another. Internet Service Providers believe that they should be allowed to create tiered levels of the Internet. This way companies could profit by offering perferred access to particular sites. (So Google could pay TimeWarner money to service Google pages faster)</p>
<p>Well Senator Stevens had a lot to say about it. None of it made any sense and none of it swayed people to his argument, but it was great for Internet Humor. Below is his speech (if you can call it that) on Net Neutrality.</p>
