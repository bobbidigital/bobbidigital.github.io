<h1 id="takingdigitalnotessucks">Taking Digital Notes Sucks</h1></p>
<p>For a long time I was obsessed with a digital workflow. I tend to avoid paper solutions. They can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be indexed orsearched and backing them up either involves a lot of photocopies or breaking child labor laws.</p></p>
<p>So I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve regressed back to taking handwritten notes whenever possible. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve tried applications like Penultimate, but the truth is I spend more time trying to avoid auto-correct than taking effective notes. On top of that there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a certain fluidity that is missing from these tools. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not sure what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s to blame about the process. Part of it is forcing my hand in a way that allows it to rest in the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;safe&acirc;&euro;¬ù area. I also have an incredibly hard time writing within the lines, so my notes become a jumbled mess of goobaley gook.</p></p>
<h2 id="theproblemwithnotetakingingeneral">The problem with note taking in general</h2></p>
<p>LinkedIn had a <a href="http://qz.com/64539/complete-guide-to-taking-notes-effectively-at-work/">really good article on note taking</a>. One of the points the article touched on however was the ineffectiveness of notes in general. Not because of our skill in crafting notes, but in our lack of review. Most of us take notes and never go back to actually review them. They serve more as meeting transcripts than they do a record of concepts and ideas.</p></p>
<h2 id="amixofoldandnew">A mix of old and new</h2></p>
<p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not like I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m advocating digital notes. But in my system it becomes more of a two step process.</p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Notes by hand - First we take the notes by hand on good ole paper. This allows us to take notes in creative and useful ways. You can quickly switch between shorthand, mind mapping and outlining without much fuss. You can represent the concepts of your meeting in a million different ways, without being constrained by your application. Another added benefit is that you can concentrate on the meeting itself a lot easier when you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re taking handwritten notes. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m guessing it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s because you have years of experience doing it thanks to the public education system.</p></li></p>
<li>
<p>Transcribe into your notes app - Whether it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <a href="http://www.zengobi">Curio</a>, <a href="http://www.evernote">Evernote</a> or <a href="http://www.circusponies.com">Notebook</a>, almost all modern note taking applications have an index and search function. (If yours doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s time to switch) By switching your notes into a digital form, not only do you gain all the benefits of digital notes, but it also forces you to review your notes. Just the act of retyping the notes will force you to re-evaluate your note taking style. You&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll most certainly find a better way to represent some concepts as you retype your notes.</p></li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>The solution isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t the best in a world of compressing deadlines. But doing something right doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t always translate into doing it quickly. I find that since I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve started using this approach, my notes are more organized, more accessible and much more clear and concise.</p></p>
