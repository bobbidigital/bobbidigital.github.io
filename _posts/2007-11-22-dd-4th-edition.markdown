<p><a href="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/phb.jpg" title="php4e"><img src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/phb.thumbnail.jpg" title="php4e" alt="php4e" align="right" /></a>So for those who don't know, D&amp;D 4th edition is almost here. It's been pretty tight lipped in regards to the types of things going on, but from what I can tell it seems like a substantial change. It's bigger than the change from 3.0 to 3.5 but smaller than the change from 2nd edition to 3rd edition.</p>
<p>The roll out is scheduled to begin on December 18th 2007 starting with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wizards-Presents-Classes-Michele-Carter/dp/0786948019" target="_blank">"Races and Classes"</a>  a small companion to the world of 4E. Other roll outs are scheduled through January and August 2008, with the crucial PHB, DMG and Monster Manual being released in June 08. As with most updates, some of the changes will be praised while others loathed. But it's all in the name of progress right? It'll be interesting to see how quickly 3rd party publishers get new material out.</p>
<p>Wizards has a column called <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drdd/20071005&amp;authentic=true" target="_blank">Design &amp; Development</a> in which they skim over some of the changes. You'll need to register in order to read it however so I'll quickly summarize here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left"> Ever faced one of those life-or-death saving throws? Hours, weeks, or even years of play can hang in the balance. It all comes down to that one roll. There&acirc;&euro;&trade;s drama in that moment, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s drama you didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t create, and you don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t want.</p></p>
<p align="left">That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s gone in the new edition.</p></p>
<p align="left">Have you played a spellcaster and been a little envious of the excitement of other players when they roll critical hits? Have you wished that you could do that for your spells?</p></p>
<p align="left">You can in 4th.</p></p>
<p align="left">The standard defenses remain (AC, Fortitude, Reflex, and Will) but now they all work more like AC. When a dragon breathes fire on you, it attacks your Reflex and deals half damage if it misses. The DM rolls a d20, adds the dragon&acirc;&euro;&trade;s modifiers, and asks you what your Reflex score is. The dragon might roll a 1 and automatically miss no matter how much tougher it is than you, but there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s also the frightening possibility that it will roll a 20 and deal double damage.</p><br />
</blockquote><br />
So some...interesting albeit vague changes are being hinted to. Sounds like it might be another round of power ups for PC's. Either way, people are going to buy it, because we're sheep when it comes to stuff like this. Oh well, at least we'll have fun doing it!</p>
