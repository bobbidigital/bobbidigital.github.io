    <strong>Sacramento Computer Repair...</strong>

    That was a creative and most exellent article. I really enjoyed the read and can't wait to check out some of your previous and upcomming posts! I plan on linking your blog to my site....

<p>The web can also be a fun source of comedy though too. Take for instance this <a href="http://volumeone.typepad.com/volume_one/2007/05/saturday_big_ho.html">Volume One</a> website. I noticed they were hot-linking to an image on my website. If you follow the link and check out the image of Ian Jacoby you'll notice that Ian is a smooth, attractive young african-american who happens to look a lot like me. You can't blame them for having good taste. If you're going to pic your own persona, might as well be one as good looking as mine. :)</p>
<p>On a serious note though. They should be careful about hot-linking to people's page like that. I could change the me.jpg image to something horrible. Hmmm, now what horrible image could I swap out for that? Would that be wrong? :)</p>
