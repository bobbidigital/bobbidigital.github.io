But that doesn't take away from the sheer love that is the Logitech Harmony 880 remote control. This isn't a brand new remote but it takes quite a bit of psyching out for me to drop $129 dollars on a remote control. This thing is worth every penny.</p>
<p>I've struggled with the universal remote battle for awhile. I've got a nice Sony Commander touch screen remote that handles just about all of my components. But what is the common problem you find with universal remotes? Programming! Digging through your old manual to find some stupid code that you can input into your device to offer the most basic of functions. The other problem is that you have to give a 3 hour seminar on how to use the remote every time you have guests. "Press Power on then switch to the surround sound receiver and power that on and then go to the cable box..." blah blah blah. </p>
<p>The 880 moves programming from stupid input codes to where its belonged all along, on the desktop of your computer. The Harmony series all come with a USB interface and a nice application in which you can program your remote from a list of available options. That list is categorized by the type of component, brand and model. It was so easy to find all the pieces to my system and I do mean all. It's currently setup to control my Apple TV, television, Direct tv receiver, surround sound amp and my XBOX 360. The only thing it won't control is the PS3 and that's because Sony, in their infinite, wisdom thought that a bluetooth remote would be better than the IR standard that 99% of devices use. I digress.</p>
<p>Now that I've got all of my devices programmed, I can begin tying the devices together into activities. For example, when I watch television I need 3 components. My surround sound receiver, the television and the actual cable box receiver. With the Harmony software I can tie those 3 pieces into a single "activity". I can tell the remote that when I say "Volume Up" when in the "Watch TV Activity", I want you to turn up the volume on the receiver, not the television. When I say "next channel" I get the receiver changing the channel instead of my television moving off the channel. You get where this is going. So now my universal remote isn't forcing me to switch the device context every time I need to tweak a small bit. The other beauty is you can set what a particular activity needs in order to stop. So my "Watch TV Activity" looks as such:</p>
<p>1) Power on Television<br />
2) Switch Television to HDMI1<br />
3) Power on Direct TV Receiver<br />
4) Power on Stereo<br />
5) Switch Stereo to CBL/SAT</p>
<p>All of this occurs with 2 button presses. It's a thing of beauty to take part in. It also learns IR commands like other remotes and allows you to assign them to either physical buttons on the remote or to menu buttons on the color display. Did I mention the display also has a background you can customize? Throw in a lithium ion rechargeable battery and charging station and you're good to go.</p>
<p>If you're not sold on this remote after reading this chances are you have 1 component or you've been laid off recently. But if you've got the cash, I would highly recommend checking this thing out. You won't regret it!</p>
