<p>A lot of people hear about these GTD applications and try to just jump right into them. They quickly become confused, frustrated and toss the applications as "crap". You HAVE TO KNOW THE SYSTEM. So if you haven't read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1207857359&amp;sr=8-1">David Allen's </a>book yet, you really should check it out first. While these applications are great, how should YOU go about evaluating a GTD tool?</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-315"></a></p>
<p>First and foremost you have to understand and know about your lazy habits and try to cheat them. If we weren't lazy in some regards, we probably wouldn't need a system right?</p>
<p>My biggest angle to examine when I'm looking at a GTD system is capturing data. I need an easy way for me to capture data in a variety of scenarios.&Acirc;&nbsp; Like most people I get ideas or reminders in the oddest ways. Sometimes it's e-mail, sometimes I'm on the highway, other times I'm in the middle of a deep sleep. But the key is to be able to capture that data quickly and efficiently when it does finally arrive.</p>
<p>For me the best options are digital tools, preferably my iPhone. It's the one device that I'll surely have on me at all times. My current method of capture is via e-mail. I use OmniFocus so I have a Mail.app rule to route specially formatted e-mails directly into OmniFocus. (This is a setting you can setup yourself if you use a Mail client vs. a Web client in the OmniFocus preferences) But there are plenty of people I know who prefer the good old Moleskin notebook approach. They're faster writers than typist and it's less of a hassle to jot something down real quick. Plus it's easy to get into their system at a later date.&Acirc;&nbsp; In situations like this their capture mechanism is external to their GTD system in a sense, but that really doesn't matter, as long as it gets in the system.&Acirc;&nbsp; Other capture ideas are tape recorders, voice memos, sticky notes or even using the <a href="http://jott.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">Jott</a> service.</p>
<p>Once you've got the items captured, the actual GTD system is again a matter of lifestyle. Most of the activities that I do are going to be on the computer, so it makes sense for me to have a computer solution. If you're the super mobile type, never knowing where you're going to be, an online solution might work best for you. I know I dabbled in an online solution heavily when I had a Mac at home and a PC at the office. My application based GTD solutions obviously didn't play nice on both the Mac and the PC. I tried a couple of Java based solutions to no avail.&Acirc;&nbsp; So make sure you examine your lifestyle and the types of tasks you'll most likely be doing. I know one online fella who's tasks were 90% phone calls. Where's the best place to have GTD? Something that's easily accessible via your phone.</p>
<p>Another important aspect is to be able to quickly ascertain what should be going on NEXT in my list of to dos. There are some applications that don't do a good job of figuring out what my next action should be for a given project. If I have to figure out what it is I need to do next, chances are I'll miss an opportunity to do something cause I'll burn all my energy figuring out what to do next!&Acirc;&nbsp; For me a tool has to have an easy method of identifying my next actions. It could be as sophisticated as looking at my projects and giving me the next available action into a neat filtered list, or as simplistic as a separate folder for me to manually add my next actions to. I know it sounds like an simple thing, but the easier my next actions are identified, the better the system in my opinion.</p>
<p>While I've shown you the important areas in my evaluation criteria, you should be thinking of your own values as well. Mine are based off my laziness. I know if I have to spend too much time doing a particular "thing" for the system versus just DOING the work, then it won't get done, plain and simple.&Acirc;&nbsp; So what nasty habits do you have that prevent you from just getting things done and how can a tool help break that cycle for you? While I won't argue the merits of this list, I think it's impossible for anyone to come up with the definitive tool(s) for GTD. It's a very personal choice based on your own personal experiences, preferences and lifestyle.</p>
