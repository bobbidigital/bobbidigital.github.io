<p>Comics have a tendency to play out a lot like soap operas. You have a core set of characters that are constantly being drummed up into drama. Guest stars come and go to fit the needs of plots. Story lines have a tendency to build on one another hurtling us towards a new problem and new stakes.</p>
<p>Comic books also have a tendency to tell stories in arcs. While the history of previous story lines exist, a particular arc can sometimes be fairly self contained assuming that you catch the arc from the beginning. But it's fairly common for a story to reference some previous event through dialogue or caption boxes.</p>
<p>Old school comic book fans will remember "Editor's Notes" where they reference the issue # in which a related event occured. That way if you want to know the history you can go back to an issue and read up. It's kind of amazing to me that as comic book stories have become more complex and inter-woven in history, that this practice is being used less and less.</p>
<p>How many stories have you read where you said "God, I don't remember that?". That seems to happen to me every time I pick up an issue of Final Crisis. If it weren't for my resident comic book expert <a href="http://www.thirdcoastcomics.com/" target="_blank">Terry</a>, I'd be so incredibly lost that it wouldn't be worth me following. Why do comic book publishers punish us for not reading every single issue of every comic put out? (And remembering it with amazing clarity) I feel as if I'm not worthy of reading a story like Final Crisis because I don't know the history or I haven't kept up with all the characters.</p>
<p>But what does this do to the new reader? Doesn't it alienate him? I'm not saying that we should ditch history. If "A Brand New Day" has taught us anything it's that. But we can still include history while at the same time giving people such as myself an avenue for discovering why an event is important or critical. It's funny the reaction of two people, one armed with the knowledge of past and the other reading it without such benefit. The end of an issue has tremendous payoff for one reader, while the other reader says "I didn't get this entire issue". &Acirc;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess my point is this. Publishers, don't punish us because we took a break while your comics sucked. &Acirc;&nbsp;Or because we can't remember every single detail of a previous story arc. PLEASE. For the love of all things holy. Bring back the editor's notes in a critical mass fashion. It would help us out a lot.</p>
<p>Maybe we need a Facebook group.</p>
