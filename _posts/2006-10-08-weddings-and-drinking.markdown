<p><img width="294" height="220" align="left" src="http://www.hinorthvancouver.com/images/vancouver/wedding/weddinghallvancouver25.JPG" />So Greg's wedding was Saturday. (Plenty of photos to come, don't you worry) It was an interesting experience. Its unusualy that I'm at a wedding with sooo many people I know or am close to. Most weddings I've been at have been with people in a different age bracket or family from out of town.</p>
<p>It was&Acirc;&nbsp; a bit of a different experience. I've never been a big tear guy at weddings but I have to admit I was all waterworks at Greg's. (Like a little bitch) An enjoyable time for all involved. Open bar sure did help too. The big guy did better then I expected. I figured he'd pass out sometime during the ceremony, but he was cool and collected. I'm proud and happy for him.</p>
<p>Haven't paid much attention to technology the past few days. I've been super busy with work. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.swa-gaming.org/index.php">The Council of Five Nations </a>was missed this weekend due to the festivities, but we'll be sure to catch it next year when it comes back. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.albacon.org/">Albacon</a> was also this weekend and missed for the same reasons. Agan there is always next year.</p>
<p>Star Trek collectors got together over the weekend and auctioned a ton of Trek collectibles from the show. They spent some insane amount of money (7.1 million?) on different items from the Trek Universe. INSANE! And people say Trek is dead. I'm still working on the screenplay and hope to have a copy on the web in the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Gotta run. Football is back on.</p>
