<p>On the last episode of DorkCast Comics Edition we talked a bit about the future of comic books in terms of its embracing of digital downloads. Can the format survive a digital age or will most of the medium's charm disappear in binary form?</p>
<p>Well I was a bit of a naysayer until I took a look at <a href="http://www.iversecomics.com/">iVerse Media's</a> approach on the iPhone and iPod Touch. iVerse is selling comics through the app store using their player and WOW is it cool. They're also cheaper, with the first issue typically being free and the subsequent issues at $0.99 cents. </p>
<p>Each panel is a full size screen on the iPhone with reading and navigation being a piece of cake. So far I'm loving it and will definitely be talking more about it on the next episode of DorkCast Comics Edition. My only regret is that each comic is technically separate application. But it's still pretty hot. Check out this video or search for "iVerse" in the iTunes App Store.</p>
