<p>This post is full of highs and lows. First of all for those that don't know there making a Dragon Lance series of films. Yes our prayers have been answered....somewhat.</p>
<p>The movies will be animated. Not entirely a bad thing. Unfortunately they hired the same artists that did He-Man back in the 80's. And from the looks of things, they're making them use the exact same tools that they used in the 80's. See the trailer below but make sure you have something to vomit it nearby.</p>
