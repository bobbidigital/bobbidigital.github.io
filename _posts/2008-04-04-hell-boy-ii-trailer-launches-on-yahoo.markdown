<p>I'm pretty sure that Ron Perlman was born to play HellBoy. At the very least he was intended to play any alien, demon, or other non-human creature ever invented by screenwriters.  So check out the trailer.</p>

<p>If you can't wait for the movie and you just HAVE to see it, I would highly recommend checking out the animated movies.</p>
