  content: Have you tried Amazon UnBox? They charge per movie or per episode, but
    you download the whole thing then watch it from the hard drive in HD, if you have
    the capability. You could watch it while it downloads, but that would run into
    even worse problems than buffering.

<p>It has been quite sometime since I've made a blog post. Between school, work, love and life I haven't had much free time. But alas, I'm mostly caught up on school and it's 8:30am so I figured, "what the hell". One of the things I've been doing in the free moments I have, is attempting to figure out this home theater PC solution. I wrestled with choices between the <a href="http://www.dlink.com/boxee/">D-Link Boxee</a> box, the <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/smartTV/revue">Logitech Revue</a>, which is basically a set-top device for <a href="http://www.google.com/tv/">Google TV</a>. I also threw in the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/">Apple TV</a> and a just a regular old PC. The basic idea was to have a single solution that would serve up all my content either from my network drives, or streaming from the Internet.</p>
<p>There was some controversy around TV networks <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-21/disney-s-abc-blocks-google-tv-access-to-shows-from-network.html">blocking content from GoogleTV</a>, which really made me nervous. You could buy a device for a specific purpose and then suddenly, content is blocked and there is NOTHING the manufacturer of your device can do about it. So with that in mind, I decided to get just a regular old PC. It's not the clean unified UI I was looking for, but it assures that if specific applications are blocked, I can always just fire up a browser and view on the web. I installed Boxee on my <a href="http://www.zotacusa.com/zotac-mag-hd-nd01.html">Zotac PC</a> and for the most part I'm very pleased.</p>
<p>A friend and I decided to watch Paranormal Activity. We'd both shown interest in seeing the second film, but had never seen the first. Low and behold, it was available on Netflix streaming. I fire up Boxee and we start viewing it in a matter of minutes. The quality of the stream was decent, but it's all footage from a hand held camera, so I wasn't really going to judge the quality of the stream considering the original source. What I will judge however, is buffering. Lots and lots of buffering. For those that don't know, buffering occurs when Netflix detects a change in your Internet speed and begins to take steps to either A) alter the quality of your video so your bandwidth can handle it or B) allow for you to prefetch enough of the movie so that you can view it from the buffers, while it continues to download. The screen completely takes you out of the movie while this occurs.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons buffering could happen. It might be your Internet connection. It might be traffic on your local network. It might be traffic in your particular region, impacting where the stream is sourced from. The list goes on. Neil Hunt offers a pretty open letter about the potential issues that can occur <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2009/03/netflix-trying-for-consistent.html"> on the Netflix blog</a>. I know everyone is itching to say "I stream content all the time without a problem." Yes, I do as well most of the time. But this was the first time I had ever watched a full length film on Netflix streaming and the experience ruined the movie. </p>
<p>Watching a film is an experience. Watching a film for the very first time, is a once in a lifetime experience. Film is an art, a lot of energy goes into everything you see. The pacing of the film, the scene structure, the emotions that it puts you through. The artist is trying to invoke a feeling in you, part of which is built upon slowly. It's about having you in that moment. This is why I prefer the theater experience over watching at home. There's no pause button, no phone calls to interrupt you. You're in the moment the way the artist intended you to be. I know I'm probably the odd-ball here. People love the convenience of being able to drag a 2 hour movie into a 3 day affair and I appreciate and respect that. But I prefer the experience. So you can imagine how much it absolutely <strong>kills</strong> me when I'm deep in the moment, waiting for the big scare and then I get the Netflix buffering screen. (Which in itself is also scary) It frustrates me to no end. </p>
<p>It's for this reason that optical media will still be around for quite sometime. Don't listen to those podcasters who live in a bubble, proclaiming the death of optical media. (They're still waiting for Linux to rule the desktop too) The DVD/Blu-ray experience is still far superior to me. There is no denying the convenience of instant streaming, but when I watch Avatar, I want no buffering. I want Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound blaring. When the movie is over, I may want to re-watch a specific scene, fast forwarding and rewinding at will. The optical media offers something that just isn't produced (reliably) in the streaming market yet. I don't know if I can ever trust my virgin experience with a film to streaming media again. I'll check back in a few years when (hopefully) our Internet Infrastructure is a little more sound, but I cannot risk that once in a lifetime opportunity. TV shows are a different animal, because I don't have the same level of investment or commitment. Movies I've seen already are also fair game. The Princess Bride can buffer all it wants, I know all the lines and can keep the story going while I wait.</p>
<p>I know a lot of this seems extreme to you, but what can I say? I respect the art and the artist's intention. Of course I'm guilty of the same thing in other areas. I order my steaks well done. It drives my wife crazy. "How can you <strong>destroy</strong> what the chef is trying to present to you?"</p>
<p>To each his own.</p>
