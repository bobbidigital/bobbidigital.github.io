If you're not reading this series and you want a diversion from some of your bigger titles PLEASE check this book out. It's pretty fun, the art is very well done and the writing is top notch. The second issue also doesn't disappoint as the story begins to unfold. My only concern is if the author behind the series can move the book along and conclude it all in 2 more issues. We'll see!</p>
<p>Check it out.</p>
