    Great post! I really liked the content and disposition in your topic!...

<p>Well I'm back on the Internet. I must admit it feels a little odd being at Steph's AND on the Internet. Then again it still feels a little weird calling this place home. It does feel a lot like home and I'm settling in comfortably. I guess I'll feel better when EVERYTHING is in its place. Not that we haven't made tremendous progress, but I'm still trying to learn and remember where everything is.</p>
<p>On other notes, I've started going through some of my old scripts today and I've actually picked one of them back up. I started writing a small concept script for a new Star Trek series. The idea took a lot of traction and quickly evolved into this feature length story idea. I'm trying to take a new approach to the rek series, similar to what some of the roleplaying games have done. It's an all new crew and an all new ship set in the time frame of the next generation. I'll post a version of it as soon as I get it into a semi-viewable state.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Greg's bachelor partty. We say goodbye to a boy and watch him turn ino a......into a punk bitch. They always say marriage is actually purgatory for another life. I don't know if that's true but the chunky fuck seems to be not just content but happy with how things are turning out. I guess part of me feels like marriage is admitting we're not kids anymore. And while I've never considered myself immature, it's still an awkward feeling knowing that we're taking a turn into the big 30. To know that more then a third of our life is over you begin to realize that all of the pipe dreams you've talked about and hoped for are becoming less and less of a reality. Saying "When I ....." feels like a total taboo. Because you don't have much time to talk about shit anymore. You just gotta go and do it.</p>
<p>Think about it like this. I'm 28. Stephanie and I just moved in. So your talking 30 before we're married, 32 before we have kids. At 32 it's quite likely that I won't live to see my grandchildren. It also makes me realize how precious the time left is. I don't have much more time to spend with my mother or my father.</p>
<p>Ok this is becoming a downer. I'm out. I have a beautiful woman in the other room to make love to.&Acirc;&nbsp; Next time we'll talk about the top 10 reasons why platformers suck balls. (Yeah I'm talking about Mario's punk ass)</p>
