<p>Interesting. I like Jennfier Morrison, but I don't like the idea of all these established actors taking roles in my Trek film.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Abrams denies Morrison is playing Janice Rand in the feature. So who then? Perhaps Carol Marcus, who would bear Kirk a son and a shiny Spock-resurrecting terraforming machine? Perhaps Janice Lester, who had a Starfleet Academy romance with Kirk long before she took over his body?</blockquote</h3></blockquote></p>
