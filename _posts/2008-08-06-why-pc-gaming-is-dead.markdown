excerpt: "I remember my first computer. It was a 286 given to me by a friend's father.
  He noticed my interest in computers and decided that when he upgraded he would feed
  an eager young mind with the knowledge of 1's and 0's. Of course I was younger then,
  so those 1's and 0's put together formed a game called Wing Commander. It was the
  greatest single experience in my young life, glued to the keyboard for hours upon
  hours. Despite all the gaming systems I owned, Atari 7200, Sega Master System and
  even the Nintendo, nothing could have torn me away from my beloved 286 when it came
  to gaming. My how times have changed.\r\n\r\n"

<p>I remember my first computer. It was a 286 given to me by a friend's father. He noticed my interest in computers and decided that when he upgraded he would feed an eager young mind with the knowledge of 1's and 0's. Of course I was younger then, so those 1's and 0's put together formed a game called Wing Commander. It was the greatest single experience in my young life, glued to the keyboard for hours upon hours. Despite all the gaming systems I owned, Atari 7200, Sega Master System and even the Nintendo, nothing could have torn me away from my beloved 286 when it came to gaming. My how times have changed.</p>

<p>There's no argument that the home computer as a gaming platform has an incredible amount of flexibility, depth and power. The keyboard and mouse combination ushered in an era of first person shooters and real time strategy games.&Acirc;&nbsp; For years PC gaming is where <strong>REAL</strong> gamers got their fix. Televisions simply couldn't keep up with the high resolutions of PC monitors, the processing power of the GPU or the precision control schemes of the keyboard and mouse. But the PC platform, much like the Windows OS that powers it, ran into a series of issues in terms of "compatibility". How much time did you spend staring at the back of a game box to make sure your gaming rig could handle the demands? Sure you could probably install it and play it, but if you didn't <strong>exceed</strong> the requirements listed for a game, you could guarantee your experience wouldn't be the one the game designer had envisioned.</p>
<p>Requirements chasing then of course turned into what I called "empty pocket syndrome". You spent a lot of time making sure that you had the latest and greatest parts when possible. New video cards, faster memory, faster CPU's and front side bus speeds were all common points of chatter at those nerdy computer shows. (You know you went to them too!) But soon I grew tired of the dank warehouses that those shows were typically held in. I got sick of spending money trying to stay ahead of the curve so that I could play the latest game. I also missed games that weren't a FPS or RTS. I missed the joy and wonder of a platformer or of a good sports title. So I went out and I purchased the console, that in my opinion, began to put an end to the reign of PC gaming. That console was Microsoft's Xbox.</p>
<p>Now understand that I'm a big boy, but at first even I couldn't get over the size of the Xbox controller. It was enormous in comparison to the PS2 controller and made it difficult for some people to play it. I remember the gang from my barbershop (who were all diehard PlayStation fans) complaining about the size of the controller and how the console would never make it. I too had reservations but two things swayed my opinion. The Madden NFL Franchise and Halo. Because I had been in PC gaming for the most part, I hadn't played a sports game in a long long time. Picking up Madden as one of my first purchases was the right move. I forgot how much fun it was to play with a friend in a game. To be able to share the same screen and have a gaming experience in the same room as one another. (Trash talking galore) It made me realize that my marriage to the PC had excluded me from an entire genre of games. Now granted you COULD buy a controller or use the keyboard for the PC, but it never felt quite right. A controller never seemed responsive enough, not to mention it was another purchase for your system.&Acirc;&nbsp; Pressing the W key to run forward and then Spacebar to hurdle your opponent also wasn't the most thrilling experience. So low and behold, the Xbox had reintroduced me to an old friend.</p>
<p>First person shooters were a joke on consoles. (Nuff said) Arguably the greatest console shooter (at the time) was Golden Eye for the N64. For console gamers the movement was fluid, precise and a dream to handle. For PC gamers it felt like there was a clump of cat hair stuck in the rollers of our mouse. Nothing could compare to the precision gained from a keyboard and mouse, let alone come close to beating it. Then came Halo. Halo proved that consoles could in fact do a first person shooter with decent controls. The game play was fast, furious and a lot of fun. Could it beat a PC experience? No, not at all. Could it compare to it? Absolutely. I won't argue that a PC gamer in Halo would serve up a piping hot ass whipping to an Xbox Halo player. Too many other variables are involved. I will concede that the PC gamer would have a slight advantage, but take special note to the word "slight".</p>
<p>So armed with these two games I began my trek down the world of console gaming. I found a few other things that really appealed to me and would help me forever leave behind the world of PC Gaming.</p>
<p>1. I only have to upgrade once every 5 years. Not only that, but it's not like there are a ton of different parts that I need to go looking for. I just get the new system when it comes out.</p>
<p>2. I only have to check one thing in the requirement section for an Xbox game. Just verify that it's an Xbox game. If so then I can run it with no problems.</p>
<p>3. My friends can play too without us bothing using shitty controllers or having to split the keyboard down the middle.</p>
<p>4. I get back all that time wasted looking for Warez sites, cracks, serials and figuring out how to get the latest patch without it detecting my crack.&Acirc;&nbsp; Come on....I would say more than 60% of PC gamers rock piracy. The pirate argument is "but you save so much money". But the reality is pirated content wastes a lot of your time and gives you ADD.</p>
<p>The introduction of HD televisions kind of the frosting on the cake, with online services like Xbox Live being the big fat cherry on top. Xbox live provides an experience for online gaming unlike any experience in the disjointed online portals of PC gaming. With HD and Xbox live the future of PC gaming stinks like death. The ONLY redeeming quality of PC gaming is the console elusive MMORPG. (at least good ones) So far PCs still have a strong lock on that and it so far is the life line of PC gaming.&Acirc;&nbsp; First Person Shooters? Console. Real Time Strategy? Console. Sports? Console. Platformer? Console. MMORPG?</p>
<p>I'll give you that one...for now.</p>
