<p>I was at my local library the other day, searching for something new to read. This is a very different experience versus going there for a specific title. Ordering books from Amazon has spoiled me with a plethora of information about the titles available. But in the library it seems there is a void.</p>
<p>I sat down at the console, ready to start searching the catalog system for new treasures. Using a keyword search, I put in the word "wine" to see what books they had on the subject. I got a few hits back, but because I'm not very familiar with the subject, I don't know which books would be recommended. When I look at the catalog entry for a book, I don't see any reviews. There are no ratings, no comments, no feedback. Nothing but the title of the book along with the ISBN, author and what can laughably be called a description. </p>
<p>I understand that libraries aren't exactly staffed to provide this level of information that I'm looking for. But this is a perfect example of how social networking can be integrated to provide users with an added experience. Even something as simple as allowing users to rate the book and write reviews would be extremely helpful. But if we wanted to be incredibly ambitious we could have features that link or integrate with a user's profile. Imagine going to the library and being able to look at a book, see who's checked it out and then see what other books that person has checked out. Maybe you guys have books in common? It would be a great way to meet locals with similar interests. </p>
<p>These aren't new concepts either. Netflix has done similar things with their service and users have responded favorably to it, so the library isn't exactly breaking new ground. The benefits would be tremendous as well.</p>
<p>So should I write my Alderman about this idea or what? I think it could be very beneficial.</p>
