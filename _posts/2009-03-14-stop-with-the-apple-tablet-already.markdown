<p>Gadget fans are some of the most entertaining people to read about and observe. They will design their dream device and pump up how badly a company needs to put a product out. Then when the product comes out, there's some reason why they can't, won't or shouldn't buy it. It's this same reason that Apple will never make your beloved tablet machine.</p>
<p>The tablet rumors are at full roar again, thanks to a <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/03/11/apple_orders_10_inch_touchscreens_for_mystery_product.html">story posted by AppleInsider</a> which has revealed that our boys in Cupertino have placed a rather large order for 10 inch touch screen displays. Anytime Apple creates a press event, there's always some maniacal blogger out there who thinks it's the infamous yet strangely elusive tablet machine from Apple.</p>
<p>But let's be honest, where would a tablet machine fit in Apple's product category? Actually I'll do you one better, where does it fit in your own product category? Isn't the iPhone your tablet mac already? What void does a tablet machine fill in terms of actual usage, other than a cool looking device? (Medical records aside) Bill Gates has been pimping the tablet for as long as I can remember and I don't see subways filled with tablet owners.</p>
<p>Everything you do with a tablet in any reasonable sense, can be, and is already being done with the iPhone. You're not going to carry around a shit-ton of peripherals with you. OK, so you might stream some youtube videos. Is the $2,000 dollars it would probably cost, really worth it? Chances are you'll use a tablet mac the same way you use your iPhone only bigger. That sets the product up for a super niche market, and a small one at that. We know that, but more importantly Apple knows that. Needless to say I doubt seriously that the mystery 10' inch screens will be used for a Sasquatch rendition of a mac.</p>
<p>To be fair, it's not cool for me to shit all over your hopes and dreams without offering my own viewpoint on the subject. As much as I hate to admit it, my roommate gave me the idea behind this. My guess is...you ready for this.....</p>
<p>An e-book reader.</p>
<p>Probably not as big of a reveal as it was in my head. And I would bet dollars to donuts Apple won't be in the book scanning business either. They're going to license the Kindle format and hook into the Amazon book store. It's not secret that the Kindle really isn't the money maker. The real money maker is the content, and having Apple design a device that is elegant, user friendly and slathered in that Apple "chic" maybe just what the e-book business needs. </p>
<p>Publishers should be keeping an eye out for this and if possible cheering it on. Digital distribution means cheaper production. Cheaper production means you can take a risk on that new hot shot writer who unfortunately has no sales track record.</p>
<p>My only fear is that the Apple "chic" sauce comes at a hefty price. But an Apple logo might be all that's needed to succeed where the Kindle has failed many of us.</p>
