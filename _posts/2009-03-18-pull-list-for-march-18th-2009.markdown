<p>I'm sitting here at work, eagerly waiting to get out so I can get my hands on some new comics! Sometimes you just get that JONSING feeling. They claim a new Old Man Logan is due out today. I'll believe it when I see it. I think I also have a trade paperback of <em>Doktor Sleepless</em> waiting for me.</p>
