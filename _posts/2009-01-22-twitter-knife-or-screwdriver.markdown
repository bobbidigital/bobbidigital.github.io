<p>The&Acirc;&nbsp;butter knife, a part of every person's kitchen, is a tool.&Acirc;&nbsp; The most common usage for this tool is to spread butter, jams, jellies, peanut butter and a million other toppings on something. Well at least that's how I use a butter knife. But how many of you have used this same utensil as a flat head screw driver in a pinch? Or used it to jimmy a door open when you lock your keys inside? Or decided to play a joke on your roomie by dropping it in the toilet and then placing it next to his morning toast? The butter knife is the same tool, but the user has modified its use based on the users circumstances.</p>
<p>Social media and this explosion of openness and entirely TMI&Acirc;&nbsp;on the web isn't indicative of the tool, but how people&Acirc;&nbsp;have decided&Acirc;&nbsp;to use the tool. Lets take Twitter for example. I have a group of friends in New York who use Twitter amongst their private circle to share information, plan events, etc. They're not really interested in finding people they don't know and getting random updates about lives more mundane than their own. They took the tool of Twitter and used it in a way that fits their needs and circumstances.</p>
<p>Sticking with that example lets say a member of this group of friends is a private guy and protects his updates.&Acirc;&nbsp; He doesn't want the world to know that he's just been assaulted by mutant tigers on his way to Jiffy Lube, but he wants a quick easy way to share that information with the friends he's trusted. He's extended that trust by allowing them to follow him. Is that breaking the rules? Should we get to decide how someone shares information about them? Is this in the Twitter Terms of Service? (I haven't read it)</p>
<p>Why do people chastise others for how they use Twitter?&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;That's the beauty of it, if you don't like how someone is using the tool then why are you following them? Lets say someone you follow regurgitates Tupac lyrics and passes them off as famous Bob Barker quotes. That could get annoying really quickly. So why not unfollow them?&Acirc;&nbsp;Sounds like a simple solution to me. I try to make the rules for social networking the same rules I would use in real life. If you don't like the conversation, move to another table or simply don't partake in the conversation</p>
<p>If I'm at a bar with&Acirc;&nbsp;3 of my friends and we're cursing and talking about bare breasted Olympic pole vaulters, would you seriously come in and tell us how to conduct our conversation? How we should be communicating with one another? No, you'd either join in and accept how we communicate or you'd walk away and move to another table.</p>
<p>Some people aren't promoting a blog or a podcast or a web project. Not everyone is looking to have their voice heard by as many people as possible. Some people just want to stay connected with friends and family. Some just want to keep a running log of their moods throughout the day. I think they should be allowed to do that if that's what they choose.</p>
