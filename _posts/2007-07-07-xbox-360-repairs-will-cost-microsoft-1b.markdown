<p>Wow. That's a lot of change. Microsoft has been plauged with issues in their XBox360 console, pretty much since it's inception. I've been one of the lucky few who has never really had a problem with his console (knock on wood) but I know plenty of other people who've received the dreaded "Red Lights of Doom".</p></p>
<p>But it looks like MIcrosoft won't be taking these issues half-hearteadly. They'll be shelling out some serious dough as well as extending the warranty of consoles to 3 years. I guess they want in the console market that badly.</p></p>
<p>My thinking is though, lets say Microsoft DOES fall out of the market. I can't imagine a world with only 2 consoles. Who would step up next to take a stab at the gaming market? I remember hearing rumors that Nintendo might be in Apple's shopping cart. If Cupertino based Apple were to purchase Nintendo, could they do to the video game market what they've been doing in the Music player (and now cell phone) market?&Acirc;&nbsp; Based on the number of games out for the Mac I'd say probably not. But hey, you never know. <br/><br />
