  content: Yeah, I just started doing this with a friend of mine in Poland. Here&#39;s
    my setup:<br><br>Two Lifecam Cinema HD webcams (one atop the TV, one facing the
    game board)<br><br>Two laptops, one attached to the HDTV, the other on an end
    table with gameboard cam.<br><br>An Audio Technica AT2020 USB condenser mic plugged
    into the laptop cam, sits on the coffeetable.<br><br>Currently we&#39;re using
    <a href="http://tinychat.com" rel="nofollow">tinychat.com</a> for
    the video, and ventrilo for the audio (since we had horrible delays using tinychat
    for audio).<br><br>I&#39;d love to use Skype, since the video quality on TC leaves
    a lot to be desired (and hardly pushes the webcam&#39;s and my internet&#39;s
    capabilities), but I can&#39;t get Skype to do a video conference with multiple
    parties, and I saw you guys had two webcams in that setup, how did you get those
    working on skype simultaneously. When I do that on skype, it puts one call on
    hold when my remote player views the other cam (thus killing the audio output
    from the laptop with the microphone).

  content: We actually didn't have two people setup. We just split the display on
    iChat so one was our camera on the laptop and the other was the view of our guest.
    Have you tried any of the virtual table top setups? I've been really considering
    trying an all online game.

  content: '@Tarin Well we&#39;re currently booked. I&#39;d recommend going to a gaming
    store near you. I think Wizards of the Coast (owner of D&D now) has a Store Locator
    option. You can always find groups there. If not, check out Fantasy Grounds. <a

<p>As readers of this blog know, I run a 4th Edition D&amp;D game at my place every other week. Our group is relatively small, so when someone can't make it, problems can arise. Our friend Matt just had a baby and as a result couldn't make the game. (He lives a good ways away)  So as opposed to playing without our fighter, we decided to get creative.</p>
<p>We moved my computer monitor out to the dining room table and placed it where Matt normally sits. Using Skype we initiated a video chat session with him and used an old firewire iSight camera to be his eyes.</p>
<p>The experiment worked quite well. The only problem we ran into was past the 3 hour mark, the Skype connection seemed to drop every 30 minutes or so. Another problem were dice rolls. If you trust your players than it's a lot easier. If you don't then having them move the camera to verify the rolls can get a little old quickly. There are plenty of dice rolling programs that you could use and share if you really wanted to. But there's something about rolling the actual dice that you'll miss.</p>
<p>Here's some video footage we took showing the setup. I think it was pretty cool.</p>
