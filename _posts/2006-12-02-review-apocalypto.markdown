This film wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t anything what I expected. So I guess technically it could be graded on two merits. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll start off the review by informing everyone who thought as I, that this would be a partial historical look into the culture of the Mayan civilization To those who think that I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll say this, don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t go see this film. This film, in my opinion is actually an action film. The Mayan culture serves as nothing more then a partial backdrop for the characters and the wild chase that ensues.</p>
<p>Now I have to give you a disclaimer, the promotional screening that I saw had some technical problems. It sounded as if the cinema reel broke right in the opening credits. When they fixed it, we were in the jungle chasing after a wild boar. So who knows, their could have been some info in between that we missed, however I doubt it.</p>
<p>The film opens up (as far as we know) with a hunt for wild boar. A group of ...people from a nearby tribe are looking for food for the village. This already marks the first problem for me. Not being a history buff, I have no idea the culture of these natives. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m assuming they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re not Mayans based on the way the story progresses, but we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll see. Back to the story.</p>
<p>The first 20 minutes of the film are actually quite funny. I won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t ruin the jokes for you, but Gibson does a good job of creating a way for viewers to relate to these characters. When you look at the actor&acirc;&euro;&trade;s in the their tribal garb, it can be difficult to relate due to the glaring differences between us. But Gibson does an excellent job of showing us that they laugh, they cry and get embarrassed just as we do.</p>
<p>We&acirc;&euro;&trade;re introduced to the main character, Jaguar&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Paw, on this hunt, along with his family and friends, specifically his wife and child. We&acirc;&euro;&trade;re taken through some typical times in the village and how life always has been. Then the Mayans (I assume) attack.</p>
<p>The village is ransacked and typical Gibson violence is displayed. The attackers appear to be looking for slaves and they do so with such ferocity and malice that you can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t help but feel a certain rage at the screen.</p>
<p>Again in an attempt to not ruin the film for you we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll fast forward a bit. A group of villagers have been captured (including Jaguar&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Paw) and they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re marched through the jungle towards an unknown destination. This is where you can go get more popcorn and soda. It serves ultimately as another tool to express the viciousness of the Mayans. (One in particular)</p>
<p>Once we actually reach the Mayan civilization, we see why Gibson has referred to this as an epic. Most of the movie really gives no sense of scale. There are no real broad sweeping shots, which I tend to expect in a film entitled an &acirc;&euro;&oelig;epic&acirc;&euro;¬ù. But Gibson goes all out once you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve hit the Mayan city and it kind of makes all the other shots make sense. It</p>
<p>shows just how far advanced the Mayans were from their relatively close neighbors. Full cities, huge structures and enormous work forces amazed the captives and the audience as well. But get your fill because you only see it briefly.</p>
<p>The rest of the film turns out to be a series of chase sequences as Jaguar Paws escapes and seeks freedom. With a few twists and turns here and there and a subplot, which I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve left out of the review, the movie becomes relegated to an action film. (Albeit a good one though)</p>
<p>I was disappointed however to not find any real educational or historical foot holding in the film. It could have just been my misunderstanding on what it was Gibson was attempting to accomplish. The film is VERY violent and quite graphic which is quickly becoming a Gibson trademark. The character development is non-existent. The film is subtitled which isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t that big of a problem even for those who loathe subtitles, because there actually isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t a lot of dialogue involved.</p>
<p>Overall as an action film I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d have to rate it a 3.5 out of 5. If I had to rate it on what I was expecting to see I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d have to say 1 out of 5. Sorry Mel, maybe you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll get me next time.</p>
