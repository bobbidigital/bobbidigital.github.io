<p>So yesterday, like many days I was in search of a song. Like any other day, the thought of going to a record store never crossed my mind.<span> </span>Instead I got out my Macbook Pro, hopped online and purchased a digital copy of the album.<span> </span>With my new cable modem the download was fast and was available for playback in seconds.<span> </span>Each of us has done this sort of thing countless times. The major difference for me was I didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t use iTunes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a id="more"></a><a id="more-378"></a></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve been trying to give the new Amazon MP3 store a real chance at my dollars tagged for music purchases. While the experience isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t as &acirc;&euro;&oelig;rich&acirc;&euro; as the iTunes store experience, there are a few small differences that will most likely make Amazon my destination for digital tunes.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1.<span> </span>Competitive Pricing -<span> </span>The Amazon MP3 store is priced very similarly to the iTunes store and in some instances has even been cheaper! I got my hands on Joss Stone&acirc;&euro;&trade;s &acirc;&euro;&oelig;<em>Introducing Joss Stone</em>&acirc;&euro; album for $8.99. Now that doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t sound like a huge deal, but if you can save a $1.00 on every album you buy it tends to add up rather quickly.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2.&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; Selection &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve tried eMusic and Napster (although quite some time ago) and my biggest problem is always the selection.<span> </span>I usually can only find small bands or relative unknowns. This can be good when I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m looking for something to break my typical listening habits, but can be extremely frustrating when I simply must have the latest Jay-Z song. So far the Amazon store has been a perfect 23 for 23.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">3.&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; Higher Bit rate &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; The Amazon MP3 store serves their files at a higher bit rate than the iTunes store. What&acirc;&euro;&trade;s that mean?<span> </span>To put it simple, better sound quality. For you audiophiles out there this alone could be the tipping point for you.<span> </span>All the songs that I have purchased have been encoded at 256kbps vs.<span> </span>128kbps at the iTunes store.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">4.&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; No DRM &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Always saving the best for last. The Amazon store has ZERO DRM. So you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re no longer bound to one specific portable player. (Although who would want to use anything but an iPod?) Move your music around without worrying about authorized machines, licensed players etc. The biggest place where this will come in handy for my day-to-day is custom soundtracks on my Xbox 360 games. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s also nice to be able to use music in home videos and things like that, even though technically I believe it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a violation of the DMCA. Sue me.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now the Amazon MP3 store isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t perfect. Of course it has its flaws as well.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p></p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in;" type="1">
<li class="MsoNormal">Amazon      MP3 Downloader - You need to download and install a separate application      in order to handle the Amazon downloads. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not a big problem, but just      one of those annoying download managers that kind of takes you out of the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;feel&acirc;&euro;      of the download store. The plus side to the downloader however is that it will also auto import your newly purchased music into iTunes for you.</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p></p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in;" type="1">
<li class="MsoNormal">Purchasing      is more involved &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; This can be a good thing or a bad thing. There are a      few more steps involved in purchasing music at the Amazon MP3 store rather      as opposed to iTunes. I fell in love with Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s one click purchase      option. Amazon tries to make a similar play but the experience just isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t      as smooth. Now if you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re a music crack fiend this extra step could be just      what you need to stop you from overdoing it. The plus is if you don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t      activate the one click, it allows you to have multiple payment methods for      your music. Running low on cash? Use America&acirc;&euro;&trade;s gift of credit.</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p></p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in;" type="1">
<li class="MsoNormal">The      experience &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; If you know exactly what you want then the Amazon store is      hands down, bar-none better than the iTunes store. But if you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re kind of      browsing around, not sure of what you&acirc;&euro;&trade;d like to get I find that Apples      solution is just much more accessible. Part of it is due to the      limitations of a web based application for Amazon vs. the richness of a      fat client with Apple. (I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m a fan of thick clients. Sorry) so for me that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s      a strike against Amazon.</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now despite these flaws, I must say they are not large enough to deter me from the switch. iTunes is going bye-bye for me in favor of the Amazon store. No DRM makes a HUGE difference to me, just because my lifestyle is digital. Everything needs to be as portable as possible. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not a pirate when it comes to music. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll gladly pay for it just because it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s so much easier and more convenient than trying to find it online.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m one of the biggest Apple fan boys there is. I know this isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t their fault. Record labels require Apple to sell their music with DRM. The only reason Amazon gets away with selling non-DRM is because it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the record industry&acirc;&euro;&trade;s way of creating competition in the market place.<span> </span>The more players in the online space that there are, the more bargaining power the record industry has. They no longer have to be forced into pricing models forced by the retailer.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It hurts, because switching to the Amazon store is supporting a strategy that the record industry wants, a strategy that I can guarantee will sooner or later lead to higher prices.<span> </span>I wish I could be strong enough to say &acirc;&euro;&oelig;To hell with them! iTunes forever!&acirc;&euro;</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But no DRM and 256kbps is kind of hot.</p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Check out the MP3 store at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">www.amazon.com</a> and check MP3 Downloads from the search bar drop down list.</p></p>
