<p>So despite some rumors the 4th Edition License will be available to third party publishers. It will replace the old D20 system and is royalty free.&Acirc;&nbsp; Score one for the good guys.</p>
<blockquote><p>Wizards of the Coast is pleased to announce that third-party publishers will be allowed to publish products compatible with the <strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong> 4th Edition game system under the new <strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong> 4E Game System License (<strong>D&amp;D</strong> 4E GSL). This royalty-free license will replace the former d20 System Trademark License (STL), and will have a System Reference Document (SRD) available for referencing permissible content.</blockquote><br />
