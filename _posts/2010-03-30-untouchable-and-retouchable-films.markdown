  content: I&#39;ve still never seen A Christmas Story. At this point I avoid just
    so I can say that I&#39;ve never seen it. :) But I digress...<br><br>I particularly
    like the list of films that could use a remake. The Last Starfighter could be
    AWESOME! Remaking Mad Max would be a mistake though. I think that the lack of
    technology when the film was made added to the post-apocalyptic/dystopian
    feel of the movie. I fear a remake would add too many shiny things.

  content: That&#39;s a fair argument. I could see that happening because that&#39;s
    what Hollywood likes to do. It would no longer be a rundown beatup modified car
    that&#39;s 20 years old. It be the new Ford Mustang with Ford Sync technology.

<p>As I get older each year, I tend to think about my life more in milestones and just how long ago they occurred. I'm not talking about the kind of milestones that go on the end of a resume, but the kind that nerds get together and reminisce about. Examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>My first comic book</li>
<li>The launch of Star Trek: The Next Generation</li>
<li>Old video game systems, like the Atari 2600</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>	and the list could go on and on. The years stack up, but you don't realize just <strong>how</strong> long it's been. For example, do you realize that The Next Generation launched 23 years ago? A show that I still watch this very day is almost a quarter of a century old! I know <strong>people</strong> younger than that. The only thing that makes you feel older is when your own personal favorite movies start getting remade. It wasn't until the <em>Overboard</em> <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/2010/03/19/jennifer-lopez-to-star-in-overboard-remake/">remake was announced</a> that I started seriously panicking about the sanctity of my personal classics.</p>
<p>As a response, I've compiled a list of films I never want to see remade. My reasons vary, but none of them provide any type of revenue, which means they'll be nothing more than another blogger with a irrational wish list. But a boy can dream.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Star Wars films</li>
<p>These films are classics. Part of their magic was the boldness of their creator in his attempt to create a type of movie that hadn't quite been pulled off. The effects amazed us and as children all of the ideas seemed so incredibly fresh and original. The character Yoda held a special place in our hearts. But as Lucas has shown us with the prequels, today's type of story telling will not be able to recreate the magic and keep hollywood executive types happy. </p></p>
<li>The Goonies</li>
<p>What can you say about this one? The allure of children adventure films seems to be fading away behind a wall of green screens and 3-D animation. In today's world, the only way a Goonies movie could be successful is if the kids went looking for One Eyed Willies Treasure online in some MMORPG.</p></p>
<li>Any of the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000455/">John Hughes</a> Films</li>
<p>The 80's are over. These movies aren't the same without the feel of the 80's and no era in the future will be able to produce the level of greed, wealth and bad haircuts like the 80's did</p></p>
<li>The Usual Suspects</li>
<p>This is an irrational choice, but it's one of my favorite films. To me it was executed beautifully and I don't see what a remake could possibly add to the story. It's also timeless in a way, which helps it age gracefully. Kind of like Polanski's Chinatown. </p></p>
<li>A Christmas Story</li>
<p>I had not seen this film until about 5 months ago and it still holds all of the charm and glow that it has been praised with for as long as I can remember. Again, there's something about that time period that gives a sense of innocence to the characters and the film. If a child in today's world wanted a bb gun for Christmas, we'd probably put him on a watch list.<br />
</ol></p>
<p>While these are my top 5, my friend Nic had a few additions.</p>
<h2>Nic's Picks</h2></p>
<ol>
<li>Ferris Buellers Day Off</li>
<p>It was an innocent tale from an innocent time.  Who didn't want to be Ferris when they got to high school?  Who didn't dream of taking their girlfriend and their best friend on a crazy adventure through downtown Chicago some fine spring day and know that everything would work out just peachy?  Who thinks kids these days still think like that? </p></p>
<li>RoadHouse</li>
<p>Patrick Swayze was made for this role.  "You don't look like much" is the over arching theme, but nowadays, it's been played out.  Zen masters with shaggy hair are a dime a dozen.</p></p>
<li>Top Gun</li>
<p>Top Gun worked because we weren't fighting a war and because it didn't talk about war. The country is too weary from war right now to enjoy it as the airborne dick measuring contest it was meant to be</p></p>
<li>Young Guns</li>
<p>First, there's nothing to be gained.  There's no better way to retell the story, and there are no special effects to improve on.  Secondly, I think it had the greatest ensemble cast since St. Elmo's Fire, and I don't think the Hollywood of today could replace that.  I'm almost afraid of what they would come up with to try it.</p></p>
<li>Commando</li>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1078479/">John Cena</a> has the market cornered already.<br />
</ol></p>
<p>Now we don't want to deprive Hollywood of all their fun, so we also came up with a list of films that could benefit from a Hollywood re-treatment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mannequin</li>
<p>Not sure who the female lead could be, but this was a role made for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0148418/">Michael Cera.</a></p></p>
<li>Short Circuit</li>
<p>Because who doesn't love robots? If we can get <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0671980/">Kal Penn</a> out of retirement we're straight.</p></p>
<li>The Last Starfighter</li>
<p>The advances in computer graphics would help this film out big time. Plus it's been awhile since we've had a Top Gun in space</p></p>
<li>Cobra</li>
<p>The return of the badass action hero is badly needed.</p></p>
<li>Mad Max</li>
<p>Another piece of work that could benefit from technology.</p></p>
<li>Lethal Weapon</li>
<p>We need the return of the buddy cop film too. Where'd they all go?</p></p>
<li>Big Trouble in Little China</li>
<p>Another genre that disappear, good ole action adventure. Not a lot of fantastical stories these days. Or there wrapped up in so much wire kung-fu they're hard to recognize.</p></p>
<li>Running Man</li>
<p>Not only will this version have a better budget, but it could also usher in the return of the super jacked action star. The Rock anyone? He needs to go back to the gym though.</p></p>
<li>War Games</li>
<p>The premise of this film is becoming increasingly relevant. If you throw in some overtures on the implications and future of privacy, you've got what could almost be considered a docudrama.</p></p>
<li>The Gate</li>
<p>Obscure enough where most people won't even realize it's a remake. Good premise, just could benefit from better execution this time around</p><br />
</ul></p>
<p>This is the Internet, so chances are something on this list (or <strong>not</strong> on the list) has pissed you off. Sound off on me. I'm curious to hear what gems we missed.</p>
