<p>Blake Murhpy compares the NBA Playoff teams and stars to some of our favorite Blockbuster movies coming out this summer. Some of the comparisons are cold and painful, but nonetheless true. An excerpt from the Sex and the City comparison.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Sex and the City</strong> as played by the Detroit Pistons: A group of self-centered, vindictive socialites (veteran players) that has been part of the public consciousness for a long time reunites on a larger stage (the Playoffs). What the group passes off as &acirc;&euro;&oelig;frank discussion&acirc;&euro; actually translates more as whining about being treated unfairly and disrespected by others, a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;no-one-believes-in-us&acirc;&euro; attitude that has become tiresome. The group&acirc;&euro;&trade;s members work best as a cohesive unit, and while Carrie (Billups) shoulders most of the spotlight, the unit&acirc;&euro;&trade;s strength lies in their collectiveness and communal talents, as they are a band without a true elite star player to speak of. And yes, comparing the Pistons to a group of self-absorbed, materialistic females is done tongue-in-cheek.</blockquote><br />
Cold cold stuff.</p>
