    the \nfirst takes in the 1940s and '60s, and some have definitely been better

At first I started to vomit uncontrollably, but the more I think about it the more I'm intrigued at the possibilities. The only problem is that Heath doesn't have a SMIDGET of the acting range that our boy Jack Nicholson has.<br />
And the comparisons, no matter who plays The Joker, will be inevitable. So if they're going to do it, they need to have someone with a thick skin.</p>
<p>Moving is coming along ok. I took the day off today so I could try and finish up the last of the packing. With Gloria moving in here soon, I just want to make sure that the place is empty for her arrival which will be sooner then I anticipated. So far the only thing really left is the television, desk and roadrunner cabling. Which remind me, I think I need to get a Wireless G router. Just for kicks.</p>
<p>The UI party bit is starting to settle down some. We got DJ Thomas going to the party (Thanks DJ!) so the local celeb status is official.</p>
<p>I also need a new camera lens, someone with some suggestions for a good Nikon D50 lens should drop me a line. This will primarily for portrait photography.</p>
<p>Time to get to packing.<br />
p.s. October 4th Lost starts again. Where the party at?</p>
