  content: "I'm not a mall shopper at all, but like to go to ours to walk for exercise
    when it's crummy or (usually) hot weather here.\r\n\r\nI took my 7 year-old daughter
    with me recently. I always stop by the Apple store during my walk, but wasn't
    sure if she'd want to, so asked if she'd mind. The reply - OF COURSE.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure if that's gravitation, but it's a powerful marketing pull of some sort!\r\n\r\nOops,
    she just walked in and laughed reading this!"

<p></blockquote>Could that be because the store looks awesome? Probably.....probably.</p>
