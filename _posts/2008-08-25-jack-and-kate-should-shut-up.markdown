<p>We had some technical woes during this episode as we're trying to find the source of our interference. Audio gets a little static after minute 7:00 and we had to cut a bit of the podcast. Our apologies. We're broke.</p>
<p>Comics, comics comics! Booster Gold proves to Jeff his book is worth reading while the Red Hulk continues to punch people in the face.</p>
<p>Video Games - Soul Calibur IV is solid gold. What are we expecting from DC vs. Mortal Kombat and will it change the fighting game genre and take it to the next level? What about MMORPG's? What is it that keeps people playing WoW?</p>
<p>Television - A remake of "V"? Why are Jack and Kate from Lost bitching about more money? Lethal Weapon 5 might be in the works. Can Riggs and Murtagh do it again?</p>
<p>Plus a bunch of other random stuff as always.</p>
<p>Paul changed his Twitter address finally! <a href="http:///">http://www.twitter.com/1000__Monkeys</a><a href="http://www.twitter.com/1000__Monkeys" target="_blank"> </a>(that's 2 underscores)</p>
<p>Jeff is still <a href="http://www.twitter.com/BobbiDigital" target="_blank">http://www.twitter.com/BobbiDigital</a></p>
<p>Shawn is a scum bag and doesn't have a web presence.</p>
<p>You can contact us via the Drop a Line page on this blog or of course via Twitter. As long as you're not a spammer we'll return follow. Unless of course you smell funny. But how would we know?</p>
