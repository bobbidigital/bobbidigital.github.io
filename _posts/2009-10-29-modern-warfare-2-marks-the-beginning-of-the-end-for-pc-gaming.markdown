  content: I saw this and although I have a console, felt shitty for the pc gamers
    out there who dig dedicated servers. I enjoyed COD4 on the PC and purchased for
    ps3. Of course I preordered MW2 for PS3 and can't wait! It's gonna slay. Play
    Borderlands yet? Fun as hell!

  content: I don't know, if Micro$oft gets their act together and brings Windows Live
    to Windows 7, allowing PC dorks to play with their Xbox counterparts, it may not
    be all doom and gloom.  Then again, that may raise some interesting problems for
    Microsoft in the way of cheating ... much easier on a PC than a console.

<p>The age old battle rages on as teams from both camps give their pros and cons on the other. But honestly with the advancement of consoles the lines are becoming ever more blurred. A recent article from Ars Technica drives the two even closer together. Modern Warfare 2 has decided to  <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2009/10/modern-warfare-2-the-case-for-the-dedicated-server.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss">do away with dedicated servers</a> for their popular first person shooter. The article details the difference between a dedicated server and the new approach being taken, but the bottom line boils down to flexibility.</p>
<p>On PC Consoles, multi-player games have a ton of flexibility, due to the control of the server owner. It opens up a world of possibilities such as custom rules, map modifications etc. It also opens a world of hurt with cheaters galore. While server ops have an array of tools to keep the assholes out, it's a war that will last as long as the conflict in the middle east. But the flexibility of the PC as a platform has often been the center of the argument for PC gaming. You can't do custom maps on the XBOX360 or PS3. The rules for the game are a set of predefined options you can turn on or off, but that's as flexible as it gets.</p>
<p>I'm not here to debate the merits of one vs the other, but I think the decision by Infinity Ward maybe a sign of the times.  Will PC game companies begin following the way of the console in favor of a less flexible system? If that is the case, what's the future of PC Gaming? It could be reduced to a large list of flight simulators and MMORPGs.</p>
