<p>It's always nice to be in a game where the Dm actually takes the time and effort into putting his games together. But the reality of it is, there is a LOT of work that has to be done.  One easy way to make your campaign a success is to have memorable NPC's. </p>
<p>Creating memorable NPC's isn't as hard as most people think it is. Most DM's read fantasy novels and try to create these elaborately flawed characters who are deep and multi-layered. Like an onion. While that approach works great in the movies and in books, the harsh reality is that a gaming environment is FAR too dynamic and fluid to have a super duper deep character. if you have to spend too much time THINKING about how the character would react, than you've already broken that seamless suspension of disbelief that as DM's we're going for.</p>
<p>So a couple of quick simple tips for Dungeon Masters. </p>
<p>1. Keep it simple. Ah yes the age old mantra that applies to everything. Dm'ing is no different. Keep your characters and their motivations fairly straight forward. Don't go all Charles Dickens on us with this incredibly over detailed history of how the bar tender was raped by wolves when he was 11 and has a serious trust issue now. Keep it simple so that their back stories are easily retrievable from your memory when you need it.</p>
<p>2. Find an emotion or characteristic about an NPC and play to it. The bartender is untrustworthy, the king is simple minded, the guard is a jealous brute, the pirate is a big gambler. Choose an emotion and play to that emotion. Your players will quickly learn and anticipate how the character will react. Just make sure YOU as a DM stay true to that emotion as well, even if it means foiling your plan.</p>
<p>3. Friend or foe. Period. Those are the only 2 classifications of an NPC. If you try to get too crazy with your NPC's and their relationships to the players it quickly becomes a game of "don't trust anyone cause none of these sons-a-bitches are real". You want your characters to be able to safely trust or distrust characters you've established in the world. It's not to say that a character can't eventually switch, but the line between friend and foe should be pretty clear. Think professional wrestling.</p>
<p>4. Create a voice or a mannerism for the character. There's no greater feeling than when players know who their talking too just by the sound of your voice or by the way you sit in your chair. This will also help you as a DM get into character!</p>
<p>5.  Give your NPC's a routine! Make sure they have lives outside the scope of the players. Maybe they always go to the south for the summer? Maybe they visit their Uncle in the mountains for the weekend. Whatever it is find it and establish it with the players. That way they know the world is a living breathing thing and doesn't merely exist only when they're in a specific space. Once you've established the routine, it's always fun to work it into the story line! How cool is it when Marty the bartender can show you the way to the next town because he's always making an ingredients run! Players can actually see these NPC's are real!</p>
<p>These are just 5 simple tips and while they may not seem like a lot, I guarantee you they'll go a long way to making your next game HOT HOT HOT!!</p>
