  People have different thoughts on the origins and usage of fear. Most people view fear as a type character flaw. But the true origins of fear lie closer to the origins of pain. It's a defense mechanism, an emotional response intended as a warning system that danger might be nearby. Like the pain felt in your hand when it's left on a stove for too long, the body sends signals to warn you that harm is coming. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_insensitivity_to_pain_with_anhidrosis">CIPA</a> is a disease that prevents the body from feeling any pain, and while this could sound virtuous to some, the reality is that individuals who have this disorder live under constant surveillance due to the fact that they're unaware of the dangers around them. A lack of fear can produce this same problem. Fear warns us of impending danger to our bodies or souls.

<p>People have different thoughts on the origins and usage of fear. Most people view fear as a type character flaw. But the true origins of fear lie closer to the origins of pain. It's a defense mechanism, an emotional response intended as a warning system that danger might be nearby. Like the pain felt in your hand when it's left on a stove for too long, the body sends signals to warn you that harm is coming. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_insensitivity_to_pain_with_anhidrosis">CIPA</a> is a disease that prevents the body from feeling any pain, and while this could sound virtuous to some, the reality is that individuals who have this disorder live under constant surveillance due to the fact that they're unaware of the dangers around them.

<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-556"></a>I was on the brown line train headed home on Friday. I had just finished seeing <em>Watchmen</em> and intended to meet some folks at a bar that was on my way home. As we pulled into a stop in the financial district, a young black man stepped onto the train, yelling profanities. He was quickly followed by a white couple, who were also screaming. The scene was full of contrasts and I tried to wrap my head around exactly what was taking place. </p>
<p>The young man was clearly not a stock broker working late hours. To a lot of people on the train, including myself, they had probably quickly categorized him as a thug or an aspiring rapper.</p>
<p>"You better get your bitch out of my face" he shouted to the man, yet pointing at the woman. "You better get this bitch right now".</p>
<p>"Don't talk to my wife like that" the husband said. Fear was in his voice and the words trembled as they came out. The trembling could have come from anger, but his face was tranquil. His wife's on the other hand was not.</p>
<p>"What are you gonna do about it? Are you going to hit me? Is that what you do, you hit women?" she said in a very condescending tone. She was so close to the black man that he had to turn his head sideways to prevent an accidental face bumping as the train moved shuffled about on the tracks.</p>
<p>I have to admit, now I'm curious. The couple was not "ghetto white" but were "wine and cheese" white. How they got in an altercation with this man intrigued me. From what I could surmise, their paths would never cross long enough to allow for an altercation to reach such fervor.</p>
<p>"Do you want me to choke you?" he yelled at the woman. "Just get the fuck out of my face!" he screamed repeatedly. "Or what?" the woman retorted, denying his incessant requests over and over again. Finally frustrated the man turned to the woman's husband.</p>
<p>"Get your wife man. You need to handle this bitch!"</p>
<p>At this point I began taking my coat off. I handed the woman sitting next to me my things and she took them silently, in full understanding. We both knew how this confrontation might end. Then something very surprising happened. The woman pushed the young black man. </p>
<p>Her shove wasn't extremely forceful. It was the type of thing you would see someone do to further fan the flames of a fracas without striking the match themselves. I figured this was going to be the beginning of round one. Surprisingly the young man didn't strike back. He began a profanity laced plead for the woman to move out of his way. </p>
<p>"Out of my way bitch. I'm getting off this train. You stink like coffee you nasty bitch!"</p>
<p>The woman refused to move stating that she didn't want to fall while the train was in motion. Once the train came to a stop, the young man got off, but not before throwing a few more expletive filled hand grenades into the train.</p>
<p>"You stink like coffee! All white people stink like coffee you cracker white whore!"</p>
<p>I don't know what caused this altercation to go down the way it did. I have some speculations based on other things said after the man had left, but they're just speculations, so I'll leave them out. </p>
<p>My surprise is how fearless the woman was in her berating. Hiding behind social and moral constructs is not always a safe bet. While I applaud her courage, I wonder just how far she was willing to push this man into doing something foolish. I'm sure he felt trapped in a way. Judging solely on the information I could observe, in all likelihood he grew up in a culture defined by aggression as a means to assert oneself. (Listen to 90% of mainstream Hip Hop and you can see an entire genre centered around this) But in this, specific instance he had none of his normal tools at his disposal. He couldn't strike the husband, who was passively standing aside, occasionally throwing out "Don't talk to my wife that way". But it was clear he wasn't an aggressor and was actually pushed aside at one point so his wife could stand face-to-face with the black man.</p>
<p>How many times have we read about this situation going the wrong way? It probably took more courage than any of us realize for the man to just walk away. His last wave of curses was his attempt at saving as much face as possible. The lady must have also had her own sense of pride and self-worth on the line, and while she had to be aware that she couldn't take him in a fight, she knew that she had the rest of society on her side. No matter what she did or said, there is no justification for a man to hit a woman. And from a legal standpoint in the city of Chicago, a black man striking a white woman is a guaranteed extended stay at the Cook County Hotel.</p>
<p>While both parties were wrong, I couldn't help but feel this young man's desperation. His culture tells him "don't get punked", but his sensibility is telling him what the right thing to do is. What if he had a friend there? Would he have been able to walk away or would his very manhood been tested. Those 90 seconds on the train could echo on for years in stories told by his peers.  </p>
<p>"Man I was on the train with Damien and this bitch was talking all kinds of shit. Like she was better than us or something. Damien hit that bitch right in the face BAM! Then he turned around and gave her man a mouth shot BAM. I don't fuck with Damien"</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>"That mothafucka Damien is a bitch. He let this white lady straight PUNK him on the train. She was all in his face shoving him and shit. He got off at the next stop like a scared lil bitchass"</p>
<p>Emasculation in black culture can have devastating effects on self-worth and how others perceive you as a man. The types of things that you allow to happen can dictate how people treat you. With respect or with disdain. With playfulness or with fear. It's not a new concept. The criminal life has long been run by this type of thinking. "You can't let someone steal from you, because than other people think it's OK"</p>
<p>It's these types of things that allow conflicts to rise uncontrollably. But when you're going to put your own safety on the line for these ideologies, you should probably be certain that you have a defense beyond social rules and guidelines. One day someone might be playing by a different set of rules.</p>
