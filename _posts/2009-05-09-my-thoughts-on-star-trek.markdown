  content: "So I think you make some good points. Although they did kind of explain
    the warp transporting in a way that reminded me of the 4th movie when Scottie
    gave the inventor of clear steel (aluminum?) the formula that he (not Scottie)
    invented. I liked that. \r\n\r\nMy biggest problem with the movie is that it seemed
    too action packed and sexy. Gene Roddenberry had a vision of planetwide human
    cooperation. Abrams had a chance to fix the American-centric presentation of the
    original series. Not by changing the crew, which he thankfully did not, but by
    showing us where they actually came from. How weak is it that Sulu's origin story
    makes him out to be a stereotypical Asian martial artist. Not original or creative
    in the least, and I think ninjas and the like are pretty cool, usually. It would
    have been nice to learn more about him, Chekhov, Uhura, and/or Scottie.  And
    since when is Star Fleet based in Iowa. Why not some South American, Indian, or
    Chinese city. I know, it wouldn't be as marketable. Although it DID work for Starship
    Troopers. \r\n\r\nAll in all, the movie WAS awesome. I can't wait to see what's
    next for the franchise."

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/star-trek-movie-image-new-logo.jpg" alt="star_trek_movie_image_-_new_logo.jpg" class="alignright" border="0" width="209" height="252" / style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 3px; margin-right: 3px; border: 0px initial initial;"></div>Before I begin this quick review of Star Trek I feel like I need to establish a few guidelines and rules about this post. I don't want anyone to misunderstand the things that I'm complaining about the film. So here are some quick opinions of mine of the film before I get into the nitty gritty stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was the greatest Trek film of all time</li>
<li>It was the most clever reboot of a series ever</li>
<li>The casting was solid and the characterization fun</li>
<li>I enjoyed the pacing of the film quite a bit</li>
<li>The love interest between Uhuru and Spock didn't bother me at all. I'm glad they spent no time building it and just gave it to us. Made it much more palatable</li>
<li>I <strong>LOVE</strong> the fact that the engine room LOOKS like an engine room. No need to hide the nuts and bolts in an area that's constantly worked on. (And destroyed)</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Now with those rules laid out, I'll begin with what I lovingly characterize as "nitpicking".</p>
<p>I thought I would have a hard time dealing with the idea of my beloved series being redone. It wasn't until much later that I found out that this was a reboot of the franchise, complete with a slightly different origin story. What impressed me about J.J. Abrams's film is that he had free reign to simply start over, but he still payed homage to the original series <strong>AND</strong> tried to setup a plausible explanation of the reasons behind the reboot within the context of the story.</p>
<p>The one big thing that I miss in this reboot are the laws surrounding the Star Trek Universe. Abrams has not simply reboot the franchise, he has simply altered the timeline a tad. But should that change the laws of physics? Star Trek prides itself on creating a universe with rules and boundaries. The stories, while fantastical, still operate within the rules established by the fictional technology. For example, you can't beam through shields. At least not without coming up with a technobabble explanation as to why we can break the rule this one time.</p>
<p>The breaking of these rules doesn't ruin the story at all, but for some hard core Star Trek geeks, minor changes irritated my nerdometer. Transporting at warp speed for instance. Remember how tricky it was for the Next Gen crew to do a <strong>NEAR</strong> warp transport. Deanna Troi made the comment "For a second there, I thought I was in that wall." Worf has the witty reply "For a second, you were." The scene where the Enterprise was flying through the debris field of the battle. While it was awesome to see the old girl dodging ship parts, the first thing that popped into my nerdy brain was "Did the navigation deflectors stop working? Isn't this the type of thing they were designed for?" I mean lets face it. A ship the size of the Enterprise isn't the most nimble vessel in the cosmos.</p>
<p>The film also seemed to further my points in my post about <a href="http://www.allthingsdork.com/?p=589">Science Fiction Dying</a>. This film was pure action, special effects and explosions. This has almost started to dip into the realm of fantasy more so than it's traditional science fiction roots.</p>
<p>All in all these are trivial details. Only the truly nerdy Trek fans may even notice some of the other technical errors. Even the insanely rapid promotions, albeit it cheesy, didn't bother me that much. The film is still a very welcome addition to the franchise. I want more, I need more and I can't wait to go see it again. You need to see this movie in the theaters.</p>
