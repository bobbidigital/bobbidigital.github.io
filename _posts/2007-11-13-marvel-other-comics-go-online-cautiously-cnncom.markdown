<p><img src="http://www.allthingsdork.com/images/marvel.jpg" align="right">  Brilliant idea Marvel! It's no surprise that most of the people buying comics these days are the adult versions of the kids that were buying them 15 years ago. </p>
<p>Part of it I blame on the comic book industry with their contrived storylines, their fragmentation of series and books as well as a general lack of fresh ideas. On the other side of the coin though part of it is due to the mass amounts of media that are now all battling for our precious time.  Part of it might be initimidation too. I know when I'm away from comics for awhile, it's always scary jumping back in. Which books are where? Who rebooted? What storylines intersect? Which books are in the same "dimension". It's really a pain.</p>
<p>Now people who want to beef up on their history or just give some old books a try, they can. Kudos to Marvel for having the balls to try it. </p>
