<p>An ISP located in Australia has a new policy for its customers. Users with multimedia files being served from their accounts will automatically have their files deleted on a nightly basis. Whoa. The company says their taking a "hard approach to copyright issues". </p></p>
<p>So as a multimedia guy who does videos, photos, slideshows etc, how do I interact with clients that have large output? "Bob, make sure you download those photos before midnight or their toast". Seems a little dirty to me.</p></p>
<p>The company does offer an opt out form from this process as long as you sign off as having SOLE responsibility for the content on your website.&Acirc;&nbsp; I just hope they inform customers of this option before they get there stuff wiped. Who knows, some photographer might be using his ISP as an archive location. OOPS.<br/><br />
