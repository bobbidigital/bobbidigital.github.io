Well there are a few bits of news going on in the Trek arena. The first being that the J.J. Abraham's  flick is of course, in classic Trek fashion, going to be set in the past. It'll follow the adventures of a young Kirk and a young Spock. While I love these two characters, 40 years of television, books and comics is more then enough. The series needs to look forward, not backward.</p>
<p>But it gets worse. The rumor is that they have a guy for Kirk. And that man, is Matt Damon. While not officially cast, he seems to be the front-runner for the position. So this immediately infers that Ben Affleck will play Spock. God I hope not. I have much respect for J.J. and I was excited when I heard about his affiliation with the new project, but now...I'm not feeling warm and fuzzy anymore. What to do what to do.</p>
<p>In other news, have any of you heard of this <a target="_blank" title="Star Trek new Voyages" href="http://www.newvoyages.com/">Star Trek New Voyages</a>? Its a group of people who have decided to keep the Star Trek Franchise alive. With some awesome sets and costumes this show looks like the real deal. I would definitely check it out. Also they shoot locally in Upstate New York. I received an e-mail from them looking for grip work. Unfortunately I can't make it on short notice, but it would be awesome. George Takei is starring in this role, so that makes it even more exciting. Anyone interested in helping out might want to check out the website or drop me an e-mail.</p>
<p>Gotta run.</p>
