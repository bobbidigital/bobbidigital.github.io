  content: "I heard about Lulu on a podcast a couple years back..and somebody told
    my of another one that I can't remember the name of. To me it seems like a great
    idea because nobody is left with excess inventory, since it's a print on demand
    type deal. Thing is promotion is totally up to you, so if you have somewhat of
    a big name, it could potentially be pretty lucrative. For a nobody like me, I'd
    sell like 3 copies. So I wouldn't expect to be flossin' and making it rain anytime
    soon. \r\n\r\nBut still I'd probably would go that route. I was thinking of creating
    an art book or graphic novel of some type. To me it would just be cool to have
    something somewhat professional  out there."

  content: I was thinking of doing a collection of short stories. That would make
    it a lot easier to actually get the damn thing done.

<p><img src="images/BOOKS1.jpg" class="right" border="2">Now I know I'm a little slow on these things, but I recently discovered this on the web and I think it's AWESOME. I know a lot of writers, most of them struggling to get their work in some shape or form where it can be published into an actual book. Well look no further, because the Internet has brought you self publishing.</p>
<p>I'll speak to the <a href="http://www.lulu.com">Lulu</a> site because I know the most about it, but I'm sure there are others. (<a href="http://www.blurb.com">Blurb</a> comes to mind.) But with Lulu basically to setup the book is free, to put it online is free and to sell it is free. The only catch is when you sell the book, Lulu takes a cut of it. I believe the cut is a decent size, but still. For someone who's book is sitting on a shelf because they can't find a publisher, I'd say that's pretty darn cool. AND Lulu has partnered with <a href="http://www.gettyimages.com">Getty Images</a>. Their partnership will allow you to use some images from the Getty Image library for free in your book! Pretty damn cool.</p>
<p>Check it out. Let me know if anyone decides to use them. </p>
