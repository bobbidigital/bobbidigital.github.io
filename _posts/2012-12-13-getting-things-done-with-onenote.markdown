<p>Being a Mac addict has spoiled me in the world of GTD. The Mac platform has so many great GTD tools, with Omnifocus being the boss in my opinion. But unfortunately my 9 to 5 job requires me to use Windows. The Windows world is a comparative wasteland when it comes to GTD tools that people can use day in and day out. In my experience, most people have a collection of tools, not quite meant for GTD, but still get the job done. (Everyone has used a butter knife for a flat head screw driver in a pinch)</p>
<p>For a long time I was caught up in the search for the perfect tool on Windows. Then one day, I was flipping through David Allen's book to reference something and I re-read the section on the tickler file. At that moment it dawned on me that while I had been looking for a tool to tell me when and how to do something, David's system was designed in an era of pencil and paper. And once I started thinking in pencil and paper format, the idea of OneNote as my solution spoke to me from the heavens.</p>
<h2>My OneNote Setup</h2></p>
<p>So as it turns out, my solution isn't revolutionary. I'm using the exact same principles that David Allen lays out in his book, but instead of an analog folder system, I'm using digital folders. </p>
<h3>The Notebook Level</h3><br />
OneNote allows you to organize everything into various Notebooks. I've seen some people use the notebook hierarchy level to separate their projects, but for me, I put all of my GTD items into a single notebook. If I were using OneNote at home too, I might create two notebooks, one for home one for work, but I have Omnifocus for that.</p>
<h3>Contexts</h3><br />
For contexts, I simply use the Tags feature. It enables me to give a visual representation for the context and a quick keyboard shortcut to assign various contexts. In all honesty though, very seldom do I actually work in contexts. The ones I use consistently are Computer, Phone, Email. I also have contexts for people I meet with semi-regularly. That way the next time I have a meeting with Tim or Paul, I'm sure to look at their context to get all of my questions answered.</p>
<h3>Projects</h3><br />
For my projects, I create a Section Group named "Projects" and then under the group I create a section for each project. Simple and clean. </p>
<h3>Inbox</h3><br />
Above the Projects section group, I create another section named "Inbox" and that's where I throw all of my collection items. Most of my work comes via e-mail, so I also have the OneNote plugin for Outlook. You can configure the plugin to dump anything you clip from Outlook, directly into this new Inbox section. It makes for quick filing of tasks into the Inbox so that I can delete the e-mail and get that much closer to Inbox Zero.</p>
<h3>Next Actions</h3><br />
Next Actions is just another section outside of projects. Because of Omnifocus, I've been spoiled by how next actions work. But in the world of OneNote, I have to (*gulp*) <strong>manually </strong>move items into my next actions folder. I actually have to review my projects and drag the next available action into my next actions folder. <strong>THE HORROR!</strong> It sounds a lot worse than it is. I've actually gotten accustomed to it.</p>
<h3>Tasks</h3><br />
Ah yes, the meat and potatoes of our work. Well, for me, tasks are simply pages inside a section. This allows me to scribble notes for the task right on the page. I can attach photos or anything else for reference I might need on the page, including files, links etc. I can also take notes on the page if I need to come back to the task later. So say for example, I need to put my task in the "Someday/Maybe" folder, I can throw it in there, but also write a short or long winded note about <strong>exactly</strong> what was going on at the time I filed it. The freedom of it is actually intoxicating.</p>
<h3>Tickler File</h3><br />
The infamous tickler file. There are so many all in one solutions that just don't implement it quite right or don't seem to implement it at all. Instead tools tend to favor reminder settings that integrate with your calendar. In OneNote, I created a digital version of a file folder. I created a section group called "Tickler File" and then created a section for each of the 43 folders. (1 for each month and 31 folders for each day of the month) It's manual, it's old school, but it works like a charm.</p>
<h3>Summary of Next Actions</h3><br />
In my next actions section, I also create a page that's a summary of all the items I have available for me to work on. The summary page is actually just a custom search which groups the results by context. But at a quick glance I can get an idea of what's available to be worked on and what I need to get it done.</p>
<p>It's simple, but so far it's been serving me well. I hope to tweak the system as I find gaps in things that I'm missing. I hope someone out there finds this useful. </p>
<p>p.s. One additional perk that I forgot about! With a Windows Live account, you can sync OneNote to the cloud. Combine that with the mobile version of OneNote for iPhone, iPad, Android and Windows Phone and you have a completely mobile solution as well!</p>
