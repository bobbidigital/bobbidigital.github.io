    Great post! I really liked the content and disposition in your topic!...

<p>I was having a brief conversation with a reader today about Star Trek Voyager. I remember making a post awhile ago about giving Voyager a second chance. Well as luck would have it, today I logged into iTunes to be greeted with a message of fate.</p>
<p>"Just Added: Star Trek Voyager Season 1"</p>
<p>Sounds like a perfect opportunity to try the show again. And I'm almost finished with BSG. Buying from the iTunes store is just so much easier than purchasing seasons on DVD and ripping them. I'm happy.</p>
