  content: "HeroForge Software also has a full featured desktop application for 4E.
    It allows for huge amounts of customization and can incorporate your D&amp;DI
    account if you have one. Though the 4E version is free to try, it is not free
    to own, but if you are a 4E player or DM this tool is something I believe you
    will find a worthy addition to your toolbox.\r\n\r\nYou can find info on and download
    the app at heroforgesoftware.com\r\n\r\nRobert Daneri\r\nPresident\r\nHeroForge

<p>I'm probably late to the party on this, but it's the sexiest thing I've ever seen.&nbsp; Some virgin with entirely too much time on his hands created the ULTIMATE character generator. And did he bother with a pesky tool like Java or C++? No, he used Excel. That's right. The hottest character generator on the market is FREE and uses Excel. Some hot shit. (If you have Excel)</p>
