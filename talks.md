I've been doing a bit more speaking lately. Since I don't have a ton of time to contribute to Open Source, speaking is an easier way for me to give back to the community from which I have so heavily borrowed from.

# Puppet Development Workflow

This is a talk I gave at Puppet Camp Chicago on the development workflow we've used at Puppet.

# It Sounded Good on Paper - Leassons Learned from the Puppet Trenches

This talk was given at PuppetConf 2015. It's really just a list of all the horrible mistakes we made with Puppet so that you don't have to. Sharing is caring. :)

# Brainstorming Failure

Monitoring is kind of a big deal. But once you get past the best hits of CPU, RAM and Disk utilization,what do you monitor? Stealing some tools from other industries we've followed a process that will help you identify the most important things your OPS team should be monitoring.

# Starting With C. Implementing a DevOps Culture from the Ground Up

I've started working on a series of talks with regards to CAMS. (Culture, Automation, Measurement/Metrics and Sharing) This is the first in the series that I gave at the DevOps Chicago Meetup group. I hope to give the next talk in the series in March of 2016.
